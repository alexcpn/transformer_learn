Healing by Primary Union|"Healing by Primary Union.The most favourable conditions for the progress of the reparative process are to be found in a clean-cut wound of the integument, which is uncomplicated by loss of tissue, by the presence of foreign substances, or by infection with disease-producing micro-organisms, and its edges are in contact.Such a wound in virtue of the absence of infection is said to be  aseptic , and under these conditions healing takes place by what is called ""primary union"" the ""healing by first intention"" of the older writers.Granulation Tissue.The essential and invariable medium of repair in all structures is an elementary form of new tissue known as  granulation tissue , which is produced in the damaged area in response to the irritation caused by injury or disease.The vital reaction induced by such irritation results in dilatation of the vessels of the part, emigration of leucocytes, transudation of lymph, and certain proliferative changes in the fixed tissue cells."
Formation of Granulation Tissue|Formation of Granulation Tissue.When a wound is made in the integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon coagulates on the cut surfaces.In each of the divided vessels a clot forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and devitalised tissue.If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary uniting medium between the divided surfaces.During the first twelve hours, the minute vessels in the vicinity of the wound dilate, and from them lymph exudes and leucocytes migrate into the tissues.In from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the capillaries of the part adjacent to the wound begin to throw out minute buds and fine processes, which bridge the gap and form a firmer, but still temporary, connection between the two sides.
Formation of Cicatricial Tissue|Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries, until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by cicatricial tissue.In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated, and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction  cicatricial contraction .Healing of Epidermis.
Healing of Epidermis|Healing of Epidermis.While these changes are taking place in the deeper parts of the wound, the surface is being covered over by  epidermis  growing in from the margins.Within twelve hours the cells of the rete Malpighii close to the cut edge begin to sprout on to the surface of the wound, and by their proliferation gradually cover the granulations with a thin pink pellicle.As the epithelium increases in thickness it assumes a bluish hue and eventually the cells become cornified and the epithelium assumes a greyish-white colour.Clinical Aspects.So long as the process of repair is not complicated by infection with micro-organisms, there is no interference with the general health of the patient.
Healing by Union|Healing by Union of two Granulating Surfaces.In gaping wounds union is sometimes obtained by bringing the two surfaces into apposition after each has become covered with healthy granulations.The exudate on the surfaces causes them to adhere, capillary loops pass from one to the other, and their final fusion takes place by the further development of granulation and cicatricial tissue.Reunion of Parts entirely Separated from the Body.Small portions of tissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of the external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately replaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.In the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or even a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.

INDIVIDUAL TISSUES  |REPAIR IN INDIVIDUAL TISSUES  Skin and Connective Tissue.The mode of regeneration of these tissues under aseptic conditions has already been described as the type of ideal repair.In highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative process goes on with great rapidity, and even extensive wounds may be firmly united in from three to five days.Where the anastomosis is less free the process is more prolonged.The more highly organised elements of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands, are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and hairless.Epithelium.

Nerve Tissues|Nerve Tissues.There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place.Any loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.The repair of  Bone ,  Blood Vessels , and  Peripheral Nerves  is more conveniently considered in the chapters dealing with these structures.Rate of Healing.While the rate at which wounds heal is remarkably constant there are certain factors that influence it in one direction or the other.
Preservation of Tissues|Preservation of Tissues for Grafting.It was at one time believed that tissues might be taken from the operating theatre and kept in cold storage until they were required.It is now agreed that tissues which have been separated from the body for some time inevitably lose their vitality, become incapable of regeneration, and are therefore unsuited for grafting purposes.If it is intended to preserve a portion of tissue for future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall until it is wanted; this has been carried out with portions of costal cartilage and of bone.INDIVIDUAL TISSUES AS GRAFTS  The Blood  lends itself in an ideal manner to transplantation, or, as it has long been called,  transfusion .Being always a homoplastic transfer, the new blood is not always tolerated by the old, in which case biochemical changes occur, resulting in hamolysis, which corresponds to the disintegration of other unsuccessful homoplastic grafts.

Transfusion|"(See article on Transfusion,  Op.Surg., p.37.)The Skin.The skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting purposes, and it is still employed with greater frequency than any other, as lesions causing defects of skin are extremely common and without the aid of grafts are tedious in healing.Transfusion of blood is most valuable as  a preliminary to operation  in patients who are bloodless as a result of hamorrhage from gastric and duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown.There is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the composition of the blood.The affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an affected family being liable to suffer.Its mode of transmission to individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency is transmitted through the female line."

SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY Want of rest Irritation Unhealthy tissues Pathogenic bacteria.SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY General characters of     bacteria Classification of bacteria Conditions of bacterial     life Pathogenic powers of bacteria Results of bacterial     growth Death of bacteria Immunity Antitoxic sera Identification     of bacteria Pyogenic bacteria.In the management of wounds and other surgical conditions it is necessary to eliminate various extraneous influences which tend to delay or arrest the natural process of repair.Of these, one of the most important is undue movement of the affected part.""The first and great requisite for the restoration of injured parts is  rest ,"" said John Hunter; and physiological and mechanical rest as the chief of natural therapeutic agents was the theme of John Hilton's classical work  Rest and Pain .In this connection it must be understood that ""rest"" implies more than the mere state of physical repose: all physiological as well as mechanical function must be prevented as far as is possible."
pinal canal|"The serum may be introduced directly into a vein, or into the spinal canal,  e.g.anti-tetanic serum.The immunity produced by injections of antitoxic sera lasts only for a comparatively short time, seldom longer than a few weeks.""Serum Disease"" and Anaphylaxis.It is to be borne in mind that some patients exhibit a supersensitiveness with regard to protective sera, an injection being followed in a few days by the appearance of an urticarial or erythematous rash, pain and swelling of the joints, and a variable degree of fever.These symptoms, to which the name  serum disease  is applied, usually disappear in the course of a few days."
Staphylococcus Aureus|Staphylococcus Aureus.This is the commonest organism found in localised inflammatory and suppurative conditions.It varies greatly in its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone.As seen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the individual cells taking place irregularly (Fig.2).When grown in artificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour hence the name  aureus .INFECTIONS THROUGH THE BLOOD-STREAM  Diseases caused by the Staphylococcus Aureus.As the majority of pyogenic diseases are due to infection with the staphylococcus aureus, these will be described first.Acute osteomyelitis  is a suppurative process beginning in the marrow and tending to spread to the periosteum.The disease is common in children, but is rare after the skeleton has attained maturity.Boys are affected more often than girls, in the proportion of three to one, probably because they are more liable to exposure, to injury, and to violent exertion.Etiology.
Streptococcus Pyogenes|Streptococcus Pyogenes.This organism also varies greatly in its virulence; in some instances for example in erysipelas it causes a sharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other conditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves fatal.The streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.At the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes which would otherwise exercise their protective influence.Streptococci invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and throat.Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading gangrene and pyamia.
Bacillus Coli Communis|Bacillus Coli Communis.This organism, which is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract, shows a great tendency to invade any organ or tissue whose vitality is lowered.It is causatively associated with such conditions as peritonitis and peritoneal suppuration resulting from strangulated hernia, appendicitis, or perforation in any part of the alimentary canal.In cystitis, pyelitis, abscess of the kidney, suppuration in the bile-ducts or liver, and in many other abdominal conditions, it plays a most important part.The discharge from wounds infected by this organism has usually a fœtid, or even a facal odour, and often contains gases resulting from putrefaction.It is a small rod-shaped organism with short flagella, which render it motile (Fig.
Bacillus Typhosus|Bacillus Typhosus.This organism has been found in pure culture in suppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal organs, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever.Like the staphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods.Other Pyogenic Bacteria.It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.Most of these will receive further mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.
micrococcus|It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.Most of these will receive further mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.Leucocytosis.Most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other pathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number of leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system.This condition of the blood, which is known as  leucocytosis , is believed to be due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the bone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and destruction of the invading organisms or toxins.To increase the resisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial leucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of nucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent.
Glycogen Reaction|"The Iodine or Glycogen Reaction.The leucocyte count may be supplemented by staining films of the blood with a watery solution of iodine and potassium iodide.In all advancing purulent conditions, in septic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated with ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are stained a brown or reddish-brown colour, due to the action of the iodine on some substance in the cells of the nature of glycogen.This reaction is absent in serous effusions, in unmixed tuberculous infections, in uncomplicated typhoid fever, and in the early stages of cancerous growths.CHAPTER III INFLAMMATION

nflammation|"These changes are common to the processes of inflammation and repair; no hard-and-fast line can be drawn between these processes, and the two may go on together.It is, however, only when the proliferative changes have come to predominate that the reparative process is effectively established by the production of healthy granulation tissue.Formation of Granulation Tissue.When a wound is made in the integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon coagulates on the cut surfaces.In each of the divided vessels a clot forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and devitalised tissue.If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary uniting medium between the divided surfaces.PYOGENIC BACTERIA From the point of view of the surgeon the most important varieties of micro-organisms are those that cause inflammation and suppuration the  pyogenic bacteria .This group includes a great many species, and these are so widely distributed that they are to be met with under all conditions of everyday life.The nature of the inflammatory and suppurative processes will be considered in detail later; suffice it here to say that they are brought about by the action of one or other of the organisms that we have now to consider.It is found that the  staphylococci , which cluster into groups, tend to produce localised lesions; while the chain-forms  streptococci  give rise to diffuse, spreading conditions.Many varieties of pyogenic bacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli communis.Staphylococcus Aureus.It varies greatly in its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone.As seen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the individual cells taking place irregularly (Fig.2).When grown in artificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour hence the name  aureus .It is of high vitality and resists more prolonged exposure to high temperatures than most non-sporing bacteria.It is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods, for example, in the marrow of long bones, and of again becoming active and causing a fresh outbreak of suppuration.This organism also varies greatly in its virulence; in some instances for example in erysipelas it causes a sharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other conditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves fatal.The streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.At the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes which would otherwise exercise their protective influence.Streptococci invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and throat.Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading gangrene and pyamia.Division takes place in one axis, so that chains of varying length are formed (Fig.Streptococci invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and throat.Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading gangrene and pyamia.Division takes place in one axis, so that chains of varying length are formed (Fig.3).It is less easily cultivated by artificial media than the staphylococcus; it forms a whitish growth.Bacillus Coli Communis.5) and  Friedländer's pneumo-bacillus  (a short rod-shaped form) are frequently met with in inflammations of the serous and synovial membranes, in suppuration in the liver, and in various other inflammatory and suppurative conditions.Bacillus Typhosus.This organism has been found in pure culture in suppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal organs, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever.Like the staphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods.Other Pyogenic Bacteria.It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.The arrest of the inflammation and its resolution are accompanied by a fall in the number of leucocytes, while the occurrence of suppuration is attended with a further increase in their number.In interpreting the ""blood count,"" it is to be kept in mind that a  physiological leucocytosis  occurs within three or four hours of taking a meal, especially one rich in proteins, from 1500 to 2000 being added to the normal number.In this  digestion leucocytosis  the increase is chiefly in the polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes.Immediately before and after delivery, particularly in primipara, there is usually a moderate degree of leucocytosis.If the labour is normal and the puerperium uncomplicated, the number of leucocytes regains the normal in about a week.Lactation has no appreciable effect on the number of leucocytes.CHAPTER III INFLAMMATION

Definition Nature of inflammation from surgical point of     view Sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation Clinical     aspects of inflammation General principles of treatment Chronic     inflammation.Inflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs in the tissues in response to irritation.These changes represent the reaction of the tissue elements to the irritant, and constitute the attempt made by nature to arrest or to limit its injurious effects, and to repair the damage done by it.The phenomena which characterise the inflammatory reaction can be induced by any form of irritation such, for example, as mechanical injury, the application of heat or of chemical substances, or the action of pathogenic bacteria and their toxins and they are essentially similar in kind whatever the irritant may be.The extent to which the process may go, however, and its effects on the part implicated and on the system as a whole, vary with different irritants and with the intensity and duration of their action.A mechanical, a thermal, or a chemical irritant, acting alone, induces a degree of reaction directly proportionate to its physical properties, and so long as it does not completely destroy the vitality of the part involved, the changes in the tissues are chiefly directed towards repairing the damage done to the part, and the inflammatory reaction is not only compatible with the occurrence of ideal repair, but may be looked upon as an integral step in the reparative process.Inflammation may be defined as the series of

may be looked upon as an integral step in the reparative process.The irritation caused by infection with bacteria, on the other hand, is cumulative, as the organisms not only multiply in the tissues, but in addition produce chemical poisons (toxins) which aggravate the irritative effects.During the stage of bacterial inflammation, reparative processes are in abeyance, and it is only after the inflammation has been allayed, either by natural means or by the aid of the surgeon, that repair takes place.In applying the antiseptic principle to the treatment of wounds, our main object is to exclude or to eliminate the bacterial factor, and so to prevent the inflammatory reaction going beyond the stage in which it is protective, and just in proportion as we succeed in attaining this object, do we favour the occurrence of ideal repair.Sequence of Changes in Bacterial Inflammation.As the form of inflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action of bacteria, in describing the process by which the protective influence of the inflammatory reaction is brought into play, we shall assume the presence of a bacterial irritant.The introduction of a colony of micro-organisms is quickly followed by an accumulation of wandering cells, and proliferation of connective-tissue cells in the tissues at the site of infection.The various cells are attracted to the bacteria by a peculiar chemical or biological power known as  chemotaxis , which seems to result from variations in the surface tension of different varieties of cells, probably caused by some substance produced by the micro-organisms.Sequence of Changes in Bacterial Inflammation.As the form of inflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action of bacteria, in

and the blood in the vessels may even coagulate ( thrombosis ).Coincidently with these changes in the vessels, the leucocytes in the blood of the inflamed part rapidly increase in number, and they become viscous and adhere to the vessel wall, where they may accumulate in large numbers.These processes are accompanied by changes in the endothelium of the vessel walls, which result in an increased formation of lymph, which transudes into the meshes of the connective tissue giving rise to an  inflammatory œdema , or, if the inflammation is on a free surface, forming an  inflammatory exudate .The quantity and characters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body, and according to the nature, virulence, and location of the organisms causing the inflammation.Thus it may be  serous , as in some forms of synovitis;  sero-fibrinous , as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming adhesions;  croupous , when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a false membrane, as in diphtheria;  hamorrhagic  when mixed with blood; or  purulent , when suppuration has occurred.The protective effects of the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes.The lymph contains the opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist the attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective antibodies which neutralise the toxins.The polymorph leucocytes are the principal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.The quantity and characters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body, and according to the nature, virulence, and location of

effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and  resolution  is said to take place.Certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore the condition to the normal, and  repair  ensues after the manner already described.In certain situations, notably in tendon sheaths, in the cavities of joints, and in the interior of serous cavities, for example the pleura and peritoneum, the restoration to the normal is not perfect, adhesions forming between the opposing surfaces.If, however, the reaction induced by the infection is insufficient to check the growth and spread of the organisms, or to inhibit their toxin production, local necrosis of tissue may take place, either in the form of suppuration or of gangrene, or the toxins absorbed into the circulation may produce blood-poisoning, which may even prove fatal.Clinical Aspects of Inflammation.It must clearly be understood that inflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather as an evidence of some infective process going on in the tissues in which it occurs, and of an effort on the part of these tissues to overcome the invading organisms and their products.Clinical Aspects of Inflammation.It must clearly be understood that inflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather as an evidence of some infective process going on in the tissues in which it occurs, and of an effort on the part of these tissues to overcome the invading organisms and their products.The chief danger to the patient lies, not in the reactive changes that constitute the inflammatory process, but in the fact that he is liable to be poisoned by the toxins of the bacteria at work in the inflamed area.Since the days of Celsus (first century A.D.), heat, redness, swelling, and pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation, and to these may be added, interference with function in the inflamed part, and general constitutional disturbance.Variations in these signs and symptoms depend upon the acuteness of the condition, the nature of the causative organism and of the tissue attacked, the situation of the part in relation to the surface, and other factors.The  heat  of the inflamed part is to be attributed to the increased quantity of blood present in it, and the more superficial the affected area the more readily is the local increase of temperature detected by the hand.It must clearly be understood that inflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather as an evidence of some infective process going on in the

otherwise under similar conditions as to coverings and exposure.Since the days of Celsus (first century A.D.), heat, redness, swelling, and pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation,

differences may be recognised.Redness , similarly, is due to the increased afflux of blood to the inflamed part.The shade of colour varies with the stage of the inflammation, being lighter and brighter in the early, hyperamic stages, and darker and duskier when the blood flow is slowed or when stasis has occurred and the oxygenation of the blood is defective.In the thrombotic stage the part may assume a purplish hue.The  swelling  is partly due to the increased amount of blood in the affected part and to the accumulation of leucocytes and proliferated tissue cells, but chiefly to the exudate in the connective tissue  inflammatory œdema .The more open the structure of the tissue of the part, the greater is the amount of swelling witness the marked degree of œdema that occurs in such parts as the scrotum or the eyelids.Pain  is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation.Tenderness  that is, pain elicited on pressure is one of the most valuable diagnostic signs we possess, and is often present before pain is experienced by the patient.Pain  is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation.Tenderness  that is, pain elicited on pressure is one of the most valuable diagnostic signs we possess, and is often present before pain is experienced by the patient.That the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of inflammation is almost an axiom of surgery.Pain and tenderness are due to the irritation of nerve filaments of the part, rendered all the more sensitive by the abnormal conditions of their blood supply.In inflammatory conditions of internal organs, for example the abdominal viscera, the pain is frequently referred to other parts, usually to an area supplied by branches from the same segment of the cord as that supplying the inflamed part.For purposes of diagnosis, attention should be paid to the terms in which the patient describes his pain.That the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of inflammation is almost an axiom of surgery.Pain and tenderness are

throbbing  character, and as the pus reaches the surface, or ""points,"" as it is called, sharp,  darting , or  lancinating  pains are experienced.For example, the pain caused by an inflammation of

 stabbing  character.Interference with the function  of the inflamed part is always present to a greater or less extent.Constitutional Disturbances.Under the term constitutional disturbances are included the presence of fever or elevation of temperature; certain changes in the pulse rate and the respiration; gastro-intestinal and urinary disturbances; and derangements of the central nervous system.When inflammation is passing on to suppuration the pain assumes a  throbbing  character, and as the pus reaches the surface, or ""points,"" as it is called, sharp,  darting , or  lancinating

active during the progress of an inflammation; and bronchial catarrh is common apart from any antecedent respiratory disease.Gastro-intestinal disturbances  take the form of loss of appetite, vomiting, diminished secretion of the alimentary juices, and weakening of the peristalsis of the bowel, leading to thirst, dry, furred tongue, and constipation.Diarrhœa is sometimes present.The  urine  is usually scanty, of high specific gravity, rich in nitrogenous substances, especially urea and uric acid, and in calcium salts, while sodium chloride is deficient.Albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases of severe inflammation with high temperature.The significance of general  leucocytosis  has already been referred to.Albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases of severe inflammation with high temperature.The significance of general  leucocytosis  has already been referred to.General Principles of Treatment.The capacity of the inflammatory reaction for dealing with bacterial infections being limited, it often becomes necessary for the surgeon to aid the natural defensive processes, as well as to counteract the local and general effects of the reaction, and to relieve symptoms.The ideal means of helping the tissues is by removing the focus of infection, and when this can be done, as for example in a carbuncle or an anthrax pustule, the infected area may be completely excised.When the focus is not sufficiently limited to admit of this, the infected tissue may be scraped away with the sharp spoon, or destroyed by caustics or by the actual cautery.While these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years that their mode of action has been properly understood, and to August Bier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a scientific and rational basis.Recognising the ""beneficent intention"" of the inflammatory reaction, and the protective action of the leucocytosis which accompanies the hyperamic stages of the process, Bier was led to study the effects of increasing the hyperamia by artificial means.As a result of his observations, he has formulated a method of treatment which consists in inducing an artificial hyperamia in the inflamed area, either by obstructing the venous return from the part ( passive hyperamia ), or by stimulating the arterial flow through it ( active hyperamia ).Bier's Constricting Bandage.To induce a  passive hyperamia  in a limb, an elastic bandage is applied some distance above the inflamed area sufficiently tightly to obstruct the venous return from the distal parts without arresting in any way the inflow of arterial blood (Fig.6).As the inflammation subsides, the period during which the band is kept on each day is diminished; but the treatment should be continued for some days after all signs of inflammation have subsided.This method of treating acute inflammatory conditions necessitates close supervision until the correct degree of tightness of the band has been determined.Klapp's Suction Bells.In inflammatory conditions to which the constricting band cannot be applied, as for example an acute mastitis, a bubo in the groin, or a boil on the neck, the affected area may be rendered hyperamic by an appropriately shaped glass bell applied over it and exhausted by means of a suction-pump, the rarefaction of the air in the bell determining a flow of blood into the tissues enclosed within it (Figs.7 and 8).The edge of the bell is smeared with vaseline, and the suction applied for from five to ten minutes at a time, with a corresponding interval between the applications.It has not proved so useful in acute inflammation as passive hyperamia, but is of great value in hastening the absorption of inflammatory products and in overcoming adhesions and stiffness in tendons and joints.General Treatment.The patient should be kept at rest, preferably in bed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be restricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and these may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if necessary.To counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into the circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms of infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicamia, and tetanus.In other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the opsonic power of the blood.When such means are not available, the circulating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of bland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.In surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the temperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed.When severe or prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold sponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of drugs.Relief of Symptoms.For the relief of  pain , rest is essential.The inflamed part should be placed in a splint or other appliance which will prevent movement, and steps must be taken to reduce its functional activity as far as possible.Locally, warm and moist dressings, such as a poultice or fomentation, may be used.It is seldom used in the treatment of surgical forms of inflammation.Counter-irritants.In deep-seated inflammations, counter-irritants are sometimes employed in the form of mustard leaves or blisters, according to the degree of irritation required.A mustard leaf or plaster should not be left on longer than ten or fifteen minutes, unless it is desired to produce a blister.Blistering may be produced by a  cantharides plaster , or by painting with  liquor epispasticus .The plaster should be left on from eight to ten hours, and if it has failed to raise a blister, a hot fomentation should be applied to the part.In deep-seated inflammations,

brush.Several paintings are often required before a blister is raised.The treatment of inflammation in special tissues and organs will be considered in the sections devoted to regional surgery.Chronic Inflammation.A variety of types of chronic and subacute inflammation are met with which, owing to ignorance of their causations, cannot at present be satisfactorily classified.The best defined group is that of the  granulomata , which includes such important diseases as tuberculosis and syphilis, and in which different types of chronic inflammation are caused by infection with a specific organism, all having the common character, however, that abundant granulation tissue is formed in which cellular changes are more in evidence than changes in the blood vessels, and in which the subsequent degeneration and necrosis of the granulation tissue results in the breaking down and destruction of the tissue in which it is formed.Another group is that in which chronic inflammation is due to mild or attenuated forms of pyogenic infection affecting especially the lymph glands and the bone marrow.In the glands of the groin, for example, associated with various forms of irritation about the external genitals, different types of  chronic lymphadenitis  are met with; they do not frankly suppurate as do the acute types, but are attended with a hyperplasia of the tissue elements which results in enlargement of the affected glands of a persistent, and sometimes of a relapsing character.Chronic Inflammation.A variety of types of chronic and subacute inflammation are met with

formation of pus, is one of the results of the action of bacteria on the tissues.The invading organism is usually one of the staphylococci, less frequently a streptococcus, and still less frequently one of the other bacteria capable of producing pus, such as the bacillus coli communis, the gonococcus, the pneumococcus, or the typhoid bacillus.So long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to withstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of ordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by inflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms, suppuration ensues.So long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to withstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of ordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by inflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms, suppuration ensues.It would appear, for example, that pyogenic organisms can pass through the healthy urinary tract without doing any damage, but if the pelvis of the kidney, the ureter, or the bladder is the seat of stone, they give rise to suppuration.Similarly, a calculus in one of the salivary ducts frequently results in an abscess forming in the floor of the mouth.When the lumen of a tubular organ, such as the appendix or the Fallopian tube is blocked also, the action of pyogenic organisms is favoured and suppuration ensues.Pus.The fluid resulting from the process of suppuration is known as  pus .In the initial stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and suppuration.An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative process is spreading.The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the surface.The swelling increases in size, the firm brawny centre becomes soft, projects as a cone beyond the level of the rest of the swollen area, and is usually surrounded by a zone of induration.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and

existence of fluid in the swelling.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with

indication of the existence of fluid in the swelling.Its recognition, however, is by no means easy, and various fallacies are to be guarded against in applying this test clinically.When, for example, the walls of the abscess are thick and rigid, or when its contents are under excessive tension, the fluid wave cannot be elicited.On the other hand, a sensation closely resembling fluctuation may often be recognised in œdematous tissues, in certain soft, solid tumours such as fatty tumours or vascular sarcomata, in aneurysm, and in a muscle when it is palpated in its transverse axis.With the formation of pus the continuous burning or boring pain of inflammation assumes a throbbing character, with occasional sharp, lancinating twinges.Should doubt remain as to the presence of pus, recourse may be had to the use of an exploring needle.Differential Diagnosis of Acute Abscess.A practical difficulty which frequently arises is to decide whether or not pus has actually formed.It may be accepted as a working rule in practice that when an acute inflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of abatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred.In deep-seated suppuration, marked œdema of the skin and the occurrence of rigors and sweating may be taken to indicate the formation of pus.It may be accepted as a working rule in practice that when an acute inflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of abatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred.In deep-seated suppuration, marked œdema of the skin and the occurrence of rigors and sweating may be taken to indicate the formation of pus.There are cases on record where rapidly growing sarcomatous and angiomatous tumours, aneurysms, and the bruises that occur in hamophylics, have been mistaken for acute abscesses and incised, with disastrous results.Treatment of Acute Abscesses.The dictum of John Bell, ""Where there is pus, let it out,"" summarises the treatment of abscess.The extent and situation of the incision and the means taken to drain the cavity, however, vary with the nature, site, and relations of the abscess.The surrounding inflammation subsides, the discharge of pus lessens, and healing takes place by the formation of granulation tissue the so-called ""healing by second intention.""Wound infection may take place from  catgut  which has not been efficiently prepared.The local and general reactions may be slight, and, as a rule, do not appear for seven or eight days after the operation, and, it may be, not till after the skin edges have united.The suppuration is strictly localised to the part of the wound where catgut was employed for stitches or ligatures, and shows little tendency to spread.The infected part, however, is often long of healing.The irritation in these cases is probably due to toxins in the catgut and not to bacteria.When pyogenic organisms gain access to a mucous membrane, such as that of the bladder, urethra, or middle ear, the usual phenomena of acute inflammation and suppuration ensue, followed by the discharge of pus on the free surface.It would appear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue, causing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small superficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhœal urethritis, the cicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the formation of stricture.When mucous glands are present in the membrane, the pus is mixed with mucus  muco-pus .DIFFUSE CELLULITIS AND DIFFUSE SUPPURATION Cellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some organism commonly the  streptococcus pyogenes  into the cellular connective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon sheaths, or other structures.Infection always takes place through a breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail, and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation becomes manifest.The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the lymphatics.Infection always takes place through a breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail, and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation becomes manifest.The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the lymphatics.The virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in which they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which they are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.Sometimes numbers of cocci are carried for a considerable distance from the primary area before they are arrested in the lymphatics, and thus several patches of inflammation may appear with healthy areas between.The pus infiltrates the meshes of the cellular tissue, there is sloughing of considerable portions of tissue of low vitality, such as fat, fascia, or tendon, and if the process continues for some time several collections of pus may form.Clinical Features.Sometimes numbers of cocci are carried for a considerable distance from the primary area before they are arrested in the lymphatics, and thus several patches of inflammation may appear with healthy areas between.The pus infiltrates the meshes of the cellular tissue, there is sloughing of considerable portions of tissue of low vitality, such as fat, fascia, or tendon, and if the process continues for some time several collections of pus may form.Clinical Features.The reaction in cases of diffuse cellulitis is severe, and is usually ushered in by a distinct chill or even a rigor, while the temperature rises to 103°, 104°, or 105° F. The pulse is proportionately increased in frequency, and is small, feeble, and often irregular.The face is flushed, the tongue dry and brown, and the patient may become delirious, especially during the night.Leucocytosis is present in cases of moderate severity; but in severe cases the virulence of the toxins prevents reaction taking place, and leucocytosis is absent.The local manifestations vary with the relation of the seat of the inflammation to the surface.When the superficial cellular tissue is involved, the skin assumes a dark bluish-red colour, is swollen, œdematous, and the seat of burning pain.To the touch it is firm, hot, and tender.When the primary focus is in the deeper tissues, the constitutional disturbance is aggravated, while the local signs are delayed, and only become prominent when pus forms and approaches the surface.It is not uncommon for blebs containing dark serous fluid to form on the skin.The infection frequently spreads along the line of the main lymph vessels of the part ( septic lymphangitis ) and may reach the lymph glands ( septic lymphadenitis ).This form is usually an extension of the subcutaneous or of the thecal variety, but in some cases the inflammation begins in the periosteum usually of the terminal phalanx.It may lead to necrosis of a portion or even of the entire phalanx.This is usually recognised by the persistence of suppuration long after the acute symptoms have passed off, and by feeling bare bone with the probe.In such cases one or more of the joints are usually implicated also, and lateral mobility and grating may be elicited.Recovery does not take place until the dead bone is removed, and the usefulness of the finger is often seriously impaired by fibrous or bony ankylosis of the interphalangeal joints.This may render amputation advisable when a stiff finger is likely to interfere with the patient's occupation.It may originate as an inflammation of the olecranon bursa, or may invade the bursa secondarily.In exceptional cases the elbow-joint is also involved.Cellulitis of the  axilla  may originate in suppuration in the lymph glands, following an infected wound of the hand, or it may spread from a septic wound on the chest wall or in the neck.In some cases it is impossible to discover the primary seat of infection.A firm, brawny swelling forms in the armpit and extends on to the chest wall.It is attended with great pain, which is increased on moving the arm, and there is marked constitutional disturbance.It is also met with in the  groin  following on inflammation and suppuration of the inguinal glands, and cases are recorded in which the sloughing process has implicated the femoral vessels and led to secondary hamorrhage.Cellulitis of the scalp, orbit, neck, pelvis, and perineum will be considered with the diseases of these regions.CHRONIC SUPPURATION While it is true that a chronic pyogenic abscess is sometimes met with for example, in the breast and in the marrow of long bones in the great majority of instances the formation of a chronic or cold abscess is the result of the action of the tubercle bacillus.It is therefore more convenient to study this form of suppuration with tuberculosis (p. 139).SINUS AND FISTULA  Sinus.A sinus is a track leading from a focus of suppuration to a cutaneous or mucous surface.From this point of origin the inflammation may spread all over the face and scalp as far back as the nape of the neck.It stops, however, at the chin, and never extends on to the front of the neck.There is great œdema of the face, the eyes becoming closed up, and the features unrecognisable.The inflammation may spread to the meninges, the intracranial venous sinuses, the eye, or the ear.In some cases the erysipelas invades the mucous membrane of the mouth, and spreads to the fauces and larynx, setting up an œdema of the glottis which may prove dangerous to life.Erysipelas occasionally attacks an operation wound that has become septic; and it may accompany septic infection of the genital tract in puerperal women, or the separation of the umbilical cord in infants ( erysipelas neonatorum ).The inflammation may spread to the meninges, the intracranial venous sinuses, the eye, or the ear.In some cases the erysipelas invades the mucous membrane of the mouth, and spreads to the fauces and larynx, setting up an œdema of the glottis which may prove dangerous to life.Erysipelas occasionally attacks an operation wound that has become septic; and it may accompany septic infection of the genital tract in puerperal women, or the separation of the umbilical cord in infants ( erysipelas neonatorum ).After an incubation period, which varies from fifteen to sixty hours, the patient complains of headache, pains in the back and limbs, loss of appetite, nausea, and frequently there is vomiting.He has a chill or slight rigor, initiating a rise of temperature to 103°, 104°, or 105° F.; and a full bounding pulse of about 100 (Fig.25).The impregnated female flea remains attached to the part till the eggs mature, when by their irritation they cause localised inflammation with pustules or vesicles on the surface.Children are most commonly attacked, particularly about the toe-nails and on the scrotum.The treatment consists in picking out the insect with a blunt needle, special care being taken not to break it up.The puncture is then cauterised.The application of essential oils to the feet acts as a preventive.POISONING BY INSECTS.TUBERCULOUS ABSCESS The caseation of tuberculous granulation tissue and its liquefaction is a slow and insidious process, and is unattended with the classical signs of inflammation hence the terms ""cold"" and ""chronic"" applied to the tuberculous abscess.In a cold abscess, such as that which results from tuberculous disease of the vertebra, the clinical appearances are those of a soft, fluid swelling without heat, redness, pain, or fever.When toxic symptoms are present, they are usually due to a mixed infection.A tuberculous abscess results from the disintegration and liquefaction of tuberculous granulation tissue which has undergone caseation.Fluid and cells from the adjacent blood vessels exude into the cavity, and lead to variations in the character of its contents.In some cases the contents consist of a clear amber-coloured fluid, in which are suspended fragments of caseated tissue; in others, of a white material like cream-cheese.The inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane that causes snuffles has already been referred to.There may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a stomatitis which is of importance, because it results in interference with the development of the permanent teeth.The mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat of mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child's cry is hoarse.Affections of the Bones.Swellings at the ends of the long bones, due to inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at the upper end of the humerus and in the bones in the region of the elbow.Partial displacement and mobility at the ossifying junction may be observed.Swellings at the ends of the long bones, due to inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at the upper end of the humerus and in the bones in the region of the elbow.Partial displacement and mobility at the ossifying junction may be observed.The infant cries when the part is touched; and as it does not move the limb voluntarily, the condition is spoken of as  the pseudo-paralysis of syphilis .Recovery takes place under anti-syphilitic treatment and immobilisation of the limb.Diffuse thickening of the shafts of the long bones, due to a deposit of new bone by the periosteum, is sometimes met with.The conditions of the skull known as Parrot's nodes or bosses, and craniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited syphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety children, from other causes.Non-suppurative inflammation of the coats of an artery may so soften the wall of the vessel as to lead to aneurysmal dilatation.It is not uncommon in children, and explains the occurrence of aneurysm in young subjects.When suppuration occurs, the vessel wall becomes disintegrated and gives way, leading to secondary hamorrhage.If the vessel ruptures into an abscess cavity, dangerous bleeding may occur when the abscess bursts or is opened.Syphilitic.The inflammation associated with syphilis results in thickening of the tunica intima, whereby the lumen of the vessel becomes narrowed, or even obliterated  endarteritis obliterans .The inflammation associated with syphilis results in thickening of the tunica intima, whereby the lumen of the vessel becomes narrowed, or even obliterated  endarteritis obliterans .The middle coat usually escapes, but the tunica externa is generally thickened.These changes cause serious interference with the nutrition of the parts supplied by the affected arteries.In large trunks, by diminishing the elasticity of the vessel wall, they are liable to lead to the formation of aneurysm.Changes in the arterial walls closely resembling those of syphilitic arteritis are sometimes met with in  tuberculous  lesions.Arterio-sclerosis  or  Chronic Arteritis .The most common cause of venous thrombosis, however, is inflammation of the wall of the vein phlebitis.Phlebitis.Various forms of phlebitis are met with, but for practical purposes they may be divided into two groups one in which there is a tendency to the formation of a thrombus; the other in which the infective element predominates.In surgical patients, the  thrombotic form  is almost invariably met with in the lower extremity, and usually occurs in those who are debilitated and anamic, and who are confined to bed for prolonged periods for example, during the treatment of fractures of the leg or pelvis, or after such operations as herniotomy, prostatectomy, or appendectomy.Clinical Features.The most typical example of this form of phlebitis is that so frequently met with in the great saphena vein, especially when it is varicose.Inflammation of peripheral lymph vessels usually results from some primary source of pyogenic infection in the skin.This may be a wound or a purulent blister, and the streptococcus pyogenes is the organism most frequently present.Septic  lymphangitis is commonly met with in those who, from the nature of their occupation, handle infective material.A  gonococcal  form has been observed in those suffering from gonorrhœa.The inflammation affects chiefly the walls of the vessels, and is attended with clotting of the lymph.There is also some degree of inflammation of the surrounding cellular tissue  peri-lymphangitis .The inflammation affects chiefly the walls of the vessels, and is attended with clotting of the lymph.There is also some degree of inflammation of the surrounding cellular tissue  peri-lymphangitis .One or more abscesses may form along the course of the vessels, or a spreading cellulitis may supervene.The  clinical features  resemble those of other pyogenic infections, and there are wavy red lines running from the source of infection towards the nearest lymph glands.These correspond to the inflamed vessels, and are the seat of burning pain and tenderness.The associated glands are enlarged and painful.There is also some degree of inflammation of the surrounding cellular tissue  peri-lymphangitis .One or more abscesses may form along the course of the vessels, or a spreading cellulitis may supervene.The  clinical features  resemble those of other pyogenic infections, and there are wavy red lines running from the source of infection towards the nearest lymph glands.These correspond to the inflamed vessels, and are the seat of burning pain and tenderness.The associated glands are enlarged and painful.In severe cases the symptoms merge into those of septicamia.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa.It is possible for gonococci to lie latent in the inguinal glands for long periods, and only give rise to lymphadenitis if the glands be subsequently subjected to injury.The glands most frequently affected are those in the neck, axilla, and groin.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is

if the glands be subsequently subjected to injury.The glands most frequently affected are those in the neck, axilla, and groin.The characters of the lymphadenitis vary with the nature of the irritant.Recurrent attacks of inflammation frequently occur, especially in wens of the face and scalp.Suppuration may ensue and be followed by cure of the cyst, or an offensive fungating ulcer forms which may be mistaken for epithelioma.True cancerous transformation is rare.Wens are to be  diagnosed  from dermoids, from fatty tumours, and from cold abscesses.Dermoids usually appear before adult life, and as they nearly always lie beneath the fascia, the skin is movable over them.A fatty tumour is movable, and is often lobulated.German authors describe an inflammation of tendon as distinguished from inflammation of its sheath, and give it the name tendinitis.It is met with most frequently in the tendo-calcaneus in gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon, especially during cold and damp weather.There is localised pain which is aggravated by walking, and the tendon is sensitive and swollen from a little above its insertion to its junction with the muscle.Gouty nodules may form in its substance.Constitutional measures, massage, and douching should be employed, and the tendon should be protected from strain.Calcification and Ossification in Muscles, Tendons, and Fascia.The  treatment  consists in putting the affected tendon at rest, and with this object a splint may be helpful; the usual remedies for inflammation are indicated: Bier's hyperamia, lead and opium fomentations, and ichthyol and glycerine.The affection readily subsides under treatment, but is liable to relapse on a repetition of the exciting cause.Gouty Teno-synovitis.A deposit of urate of soda beneath the endothelial covering of tendons or of that lining their sheaths is commonly met with in gouty subjects.The accumulation of urates may result in the formation of visible nodular swellings, varying in size from a pea to a cherry, attached to the tendon and moving with it.They may be merely unsightly, or they may interfere with the use of the tendon.Recurrent attacks of inflammation are prone to occur.We have removed such gouty masses with satisfactory results.Suppurative Teno-synovitis.This form usually follows upon infected wounds of the fingers especially of the thumb or little finger and is a frequent sequel to whitlow; it may also follow amputation of a finger.Once the infection has gained access to the sheath, it tends to spread, and may reach the palm or even the forearm, being then associated with cellulitis.In moderately acute cases the tendon and its sheath become covered with granulations, which subsequently lead to the formation of adhesions; while in more acute cases the tendon sloughs.After the inflammation has subsided, active and passive movements are employed to prevent the formation of adhesions between the tendon and its sheath.If the tendon sloughs, the dead portion should be cut away, as its separation is extremely slow and is attended with prolonged suppuration.Gonorrhœal Teno-synovitis.This is met with especially in the tendon sheaths about the wrist and ankle.It may occur in a mild form, with pain, impairment of movement, and œdema, and sometimes an elongated, fluctuating swelling, the result of serous effusion into the sheath.This condition may alternate with a gonorrhœal affection of one of the larger joints.In a number of cases the inflammation is acute and the patient is unable to use the limb; the part is hot, swollen, and tender, and fluctuation can be detected in the bursa.In the majority the condition is chronic, and the chief feature is the gradual accumulation of fluid constituting the  bursal hydrops  or  hygroma .When the affection has lasted some time, or has frequently relapsed, the wall of the bursa becomes thickened by fibrous tissue, which may be deposited irregularly, so that septa, bands, or fringes are formed, not unlike those met with in arthritis deformans.These fringes may be detached and form loose bodies like those met with in joints; less frequently there are fibrinous bodies of the melon-seed type, sometimes moulded into circular discs like wafers.The presence of irregular thickenings of the wall, or of loose bodies, may be recognised on palpation, especially in superficial bursa, if the sac is not tensely filled with fluid.The thickening of the wall may take place in a uniform and concentric fashion, resulting in the formation of a fibrous tumour  the solid bursal tumour  a small cavity remaining in the centre which serves to distinguish it from a new growth or neoplasm.We shall restrict the term to inflammation in the first of these situations.Inflammation at the ossifying junction is included under the term osteomyelitis.The term  rarefying ostitis  is applied to any process that is attended with excessive absorption of the framework of a bone, whereby it becomes more porous or spongy than it was before, a condition known as  osteoporosis .The term  caries  is employed to indicate any diseased process associated with crumbling away of the trabecular framework of a bone.It may be considered as the equivalent of ulceration or molecular destruction in the soft parts.The carious process is preceded by the formation of granulation tissue in the marrow or periosteum, which eats away and replaces the bone in contact with it.Inflammation at the ossifying junction is included under the term osteomyelitis.The term

or molecular destruction in the soft parts.The carious process is preceded by the formation of granulation tissue in the marrow or periosteum, which eats away and replaces the bone in contact with it.The subsequent degeneration and death of the granulation tissue under the necrotic influence of bacterial toxins results in disintegration and crumbling away of the trabecular framework of the portion of bone affected.One of the manifestations of gout is that certain joints are liable to attacks of inflammation associated with the deposit of a chalk-like material composed of sodium biurate, chiefly in the matrix of the articular cartilage, it may be in streaks or patches towards the central area of the joint, or throughout the entire extent of the cartilage, which appears as if it had been painted over with plaster of Paris.As a result of this uratic infiltration, the cartilage loses its vitality and crumbles away, leading to the formation of what are known as gouty ulcers, and these may extend through the cartilage and invade the bone.The deposit of urates in the synovial membrane is attended with effusion into the joint and the formation of adhesions, while in the ligaments and peri-articular structures it leads to the formation of scar tissue.The metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe, on one or on both sides, is that most frequently affected.The disease is met with in men after middle life, and while common enough in England and Ireland, is almost unknown in hospital practice in Scotland.The  clinical features  are characteristic.This term is applied to a condition which sometimes follows upon acute articular rheumatism in persons presenting a family tendency to acute rheumatism or to inflammations of serous membranes, and manifesting other evidence of the rheumatic taint, such as chorea or rheumatic nodules.The changes in the joints involve almost exclusively the synovial membrane and the ligaments; they consist in cellular infiltration and exudation, resulting in the formation of new connective tissue which encroaches on the cavity of the joint and gives rise to adhesions, and by contracting causes stiffness and deformity.The articular cartilages may subsequently be transformed into connective tissue, with consequent fibrous ankylosis and obliteration of the joint.The bones are affected only in so far as they undergo fatty atrophy from disuse of the limb, or alteration in their configuration as a result of partial dislocation.Osseous ankylosis may occur, especially in the small joints of the hand and foot.The disease is generally poly-articular and may be met with in childhood and youth as well as in adult life."
hamorrhagic|Thus it may be  serous , as in some forms of synovitis;  sero-fibrinous , as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming adhesions;  croupous , when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a false membrane, as in diphtheria;  hamorrhagic  when mixed with blood; or  purulent , when suppuration has occurred.The protective effects of the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes.The lymph contains the opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist the attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective antibodies which neutralise the toxins.The polymorph leucocytes are the principal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.If the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful, the irritant effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and  resolution  is said to take place.Certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore the condition to the normal, and  repair  ensues after the manner already described.
General Treatment|General Treatment.The patient should be kept at rest, preferably in bed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be restricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and these may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if necessary.To counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into the circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms of infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicamia, and tetanus.In other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the opsonic power of the blood.When such means are not available, the circulating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of bland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.The elimination of the toxins is promoted by securing free action of the emunctories.
amœboid movement|"These act as phagocytes, their function being to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and this performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of their amœboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing fibroblasts.Beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play any direct part in the reparative process.These young capillary loops, with their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue, which is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it begins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.If a film of fresh pus is examined under the microscope, the pus cells are seen to have a well-defined rounded outline, and to contain a finely granular protoplasm and a multi-partite nucleus; if still warm, the cells may exhibit amœboid movement.In stained films the nuclei take the stain well.In older pus cells the outline is irregular, the protoplasm coarsely granular, and the nuclei disintegrated, no longer taking the stain.Variations from Typical Pus.Pus from old-standing sinuses is often watery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells.Where the granulations are vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with red corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris mixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to be ""grumous."""

ACUTE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABSCESS|ACUTE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABSCESS Any tissue of the body may be the seat of an acute abscess, and there are many routes by which the bacteria may gain access to the affected area.For example: an abscess in the integument or subcutaneous cellular tissue usually results from infection by organisms which have entered through a wound or abrasion of the surface, or along the ducts of the skin; an abscess in the breast from organisms which have passed along the milk ducts opening on the nipple, or along the lymphatics which accompany these.An abscess in a lymph gland is usually due to infection passing by way of the lymph channels from the area of skin or mucous membrane drained by them.Abscesses in internal organs, such as the kidney, liver, or brain, usually result from organisms carried in the blood-stream from some focus of infection elsewhere in the body.A knowledge of the possible avenues of infection is of clinical importance, as it may enable the source of a given abscess to be traced and dealt with.In suppuration in the Fallopian tube (pyosalpynx), for example, the fact that the most common origin of the infection is in the genital passage, leads to examination for vaginal discharge; and if none is present, the abscess is probably due to infection carried in the blood-stream from some primary focus about the mouth, such as a gumboil or an infective sore throat.
Acute Circumscribed Abscess|Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.In the initial stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and suppuration.An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative process is spreading.The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the surface.
anti-streptococcic|The general treatment of toxamia must be carried out, and in cases due to infection by streptococci, anti-streptococcic serum may be used.In a few cases, amputation well above the seat of disease, by removing the source of toxin production, offers the only means of saving the patient.WHITLOW The clinical term whitlow is applied to an acute infection, usually followed by suppuration, commonly met with in the fingers, less frequently in the toes.The point of infection is often trivial a pin-prick, a puncture caused by a splinter of wood, a scratch, or even an imperceptible lesion of the skin.Several varieties of whitlow are recognised, but while it is convenient to describe them separately, it is to be clearly understood that clinically they merge one into another, and it is not always possible to determine in which connective-tissue plane a given infection has originated.Initial Stage.It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the proper strain of streptococcus.It is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are rigidly carried out.DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.
Initial Stage|Initial Stage.Attention is usually first attracted to the condition by a sensation of tightness in the finger and tenderness when the part is squeezed or knocked against anything.In the course of a few hours the part becomes red and swollen; there is continuous pain, which soon assumes a throbbing character, particularly when the hand is dependent, and may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and the patient may feel generally out of sorts.If a constricting band is applied at this stage, the infection can usually be checked and the occurrence of suppuration prevented.If this fails, or if the condition is allowed to go untreated, the inflammatory reaction increases and terminates in suppuration, giving rise to one or other of the forms of whitlow to be described.The Purulent Blister.
The Purulent Blister|The Purulent Blister.In the most superficial variety, pus forms between the rete Malpighii and the stratum corneum of the skin, the latter being raised as a blister in which fluctuation can be detected (Fig.9, a).This is commonly met with in the palm of the hand of labouring men who have recently resumed work after a spell of idleness.When the blister forms near the tip of the finger, the pus burrows under the nail which corresponds to the stratum corneum raising it from its bed.There is some local heat and discoloration, and considerable pain and tenderness, but little or no constitutional disturbance.
Clinical Examination|Clinical Examination of an Ulcer.In examining any ulcer, we observe (1) Its  base  or  floor , noting the presence or absence of granulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and whether they are depressed or elevated in relation to the surrounding parts.(2) The  discharge  as to quantity, consistence, colour, composition, and odour.(3) The  edges , noting particularly whether or not the marginal epithelium is attempting to grow over the surface; also their shape, regularity, thickness, and whether undermined or overlapping, everted or depressed.(4) The  surrounding tissues , as to whether they are congested, œdematous, inflamed, indurated, or otherwise.(5) Whether or not there is  pain  or tenderness in the raw surface or its surroundings.
Classification of Ulcers|Classification of Ulcers.The nomenclature of ulcers is much involved and gives rise to great confusion, chiefly for the reason that no one basis of classification has been adopted.Thus some ulcers are named according to the causes at work in producing or maintaining them for example, the traumatic, the septic, and the varicose ulcer; some from the constitutional element present, as the gouty and the diabetic ulcer; and others according to the condition in which they happen to be when seen by the surgeon, such as the weak, the inflamed, and the callous ulcer.So long as we retain these names it will be impossible to find a single basis for classification; and yet many of the terms are so descriptive and so generally understood that it is undesirable to abolish them.We must therefore remain content with a clinical arrangement of ulcers, it cannot be called a classification, considering any given ulcer from two points of view: first its  cause , and second its  present condition .This method of studying ulcers has the practical advantage that it furnishes us with the main indications for treatment as well as for diagnosis: the cause must be removed, and the condition so modified as to convert the ulcer into an aseptic healing sore.

Traumatism|According to cause:      Traumatism ,  Imperfect circulation ,  Imperfect nerve-supply ,      Constitutional causes  B.According to condition:  Healing ,      Stationary ,  Spreading .Treatment.The process of  ulceration  may be defined as the molecular or cellular death of tissue taking place on a free surface.It is essentially of the same nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent discharge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an abscess, at once escapes on the surface.An  ulcer  is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain conditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of repair.Although any given ulcer may be due to a combination of causes, it is convenient to describe the following groups:  Ulcers due to Traumatism.Traumatism in the form of a  crush  or  bruise  is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by directly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it is rendered a suitable soil for bacteria.If these gain access, in the course of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish colour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an unhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.Heat  and  prolonged exposure to the Röntgen rays  or  to radium emanations  act in a similar way.The  pressure  of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so far interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the skin sloughs, leaving an open sore.This is most liable to occur in patients who suffer from some nerve lesion such as anterior poliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.Traumatism in the form of a  crush  or  bruise  is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by directly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it is rendered a suitable soil for bacteria.If these gain access, in the course of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish colour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an unhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.Heat  and  prolonged exposure to the Röntgen rays  or  to radium emanations  act in a similar way.The  pressure  of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so far interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the skin sloughs, leaving an open sore.This is most liable to occur in patients who suffer from some nerve lesion such as anterior poliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.Splint-pressure sores are usually situated over bony prominences, such as the malleoli, the condyles of the femur or humerus, the head of the fibula, the dorsum of the foot, or the base of the fifth metatarsal bone.
syringo-myelia|"The  perforating ulcer of the foot  is a peculiar type of sore which occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis, and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia (Fig.15).It also occurs in patients suffering from glycosuria, and is usually associated with arterio-sclerosis local or general.Perforating ulcer is met with most frequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.A callosity forms and suppuration occurs under it, the pus escaping through a small hole in the centre.The process slowly and gradually spreads deeper and deeper, till eventually the bone or joint is reached, and becomes implicated in the destructive process hence the term ""perforating ulcer."""
grey shreddy|The base is soft, pale, and covered with feeble granulations and grey shreddy sloughs.The edges are of a dull blue or purple colour, and gradually thin out towards their free margins, and in addition are characteristically undermined, so that a probe can be passed for some distance between the floor of the ulcer and the thinned-out edges.Thin, devitalised tags of skin often stretch from side to side of the ulcer.The outline is irregular; small perforations often occur through the skin, and a thin, watery discharge, containing grey shreds of tuberculous debris, escapes.Bazin's Disease.This term is applied to an affection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue which bears certain resemblances to tuberculosis.
rficial syphilitic gummata|The condition begins by the formation in the skin and subcutaneous tissue of dusky or livid nodules of induration, which soften and ulcerate, forming small open sores with ragged and undermined edges, not unlike those resulting from the breaking down of superficial syphilitic gummata (Fig.16).Fresh crops of nodules appear in the neighbourhood of the ulcers, and in turn break down.While in the nodular stage the affection is sometimes painful, but with the formation of the ulcer the pain subsides.The disease runs a chronic course, and may slowly extend over a wide area in spite of the usual methods of treatment.After lasting for some months, or even years, however, it may eventually undergo spontaneous cure.
B.  Arrangement of Ulcers|
d.  Management of a Healing Sore|
Traumatic Group|Traumatic Group.The  prophylaxis  of these ulcers consists in excluding bacteria, by cleansing crushed or bruised parts, and applying sterilised dressings and properly adjusted splints.If there is reason to fear that the disinfection has not been complete, a Bier's constricting bandage should be applied for some hours each day.These measures will often prevent a grossly injured portion of skin dying, and will ensure asepticity should it do so.In the event of the skin giving way, the same form of dressing should be continued till the slough has separated and a healthy granulating surface is formed.The protective dressing appropriate to a healing sore is then substituted.
the intra-venou|"No ulcerative process responds so readily to medicinal treatment as the  syphilitic ulcer  does to the intra-venous administration of arsenical preparations of the ""606"" or ""914"" groups or to full doses of iodide of potassium and mercury, and the local application of black wash.When the ulceration has lasted for a long time, however, and is widespread and deep, the duration of treatment is materially shortened by a thorough scraping with the sharp spoon.Treatment in relation to the Condition of the Ulcer.Ulcers in a weak condition.If the weak condition of the ulcer is due to anamia or kidney disease, these affections must first be treated.Locally, the imperfect granulations should be scraped away, and some stimulating agent applied to the raw surface to promote the growth of healthy granulations.When the intra-venous method is not available, one or two pints of saline solution with adrenalin should be slowly introduced into the rectum, by means of a long rubber tube and a filler.Satisfactory, although less rapidly obtained results follow the introduction of saline solution into the cellular tissue for example, under the mamma, into the axilla, or under the skin of the back.If the patient can retain fluids taken by the mouth such as hot coffee, barley water, or soda water these should be freely given, unless the injury necessitates operative treatment under a general anasthetic.Transfusion of blood is most valuable as  a preliminary to operation  in patients who are bloodless as a result of hamorrhage from gastric and duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown."
Ambulatory Treatment|Ambulatory Treatment.When the circumstances of the patient forbid his lying up in bed, the healing of the ulcer is much delayed.He should be instructed to take every possible opportunity of placing the limb in an elevated position, and must constantly wear a firm bandage of  elastic webbing .This webbing is porous and admits of evaporation of the skin and wound secretions an advantage it has over Martin's rubber bandage.The bandage should extend from the toes to well above the knee, and should always be applied while the patient is in the recumbent position with the leg elevated, preferably before getting out of bed in the morning.Additional support is given to the veins if the bandage is applied as a figure of eight.
Moist  Varieties Gangrene|"CHAPTER VI GANGRENE

Definition Types:  Dry ,  Moist  Varieties Gangrene primarily due to     interference with circulation:  Senile gangrene ;  Embolic     gangrene ;  Gangrene following ligation of arteries ;  Gangrene     from mechanical causes ;  Gangrene from heat, chemical agents, and     cold ;  Diabetic gangrene ;  Gangrene associated with spasm of     blood vessels ;  Raynaud's disease ;  Angio-sclerotic gangrene ;      Gangrene from ergot .Bacterial varieties of gangrene.Pathology  clinical varieties  Acute infective gangrene ;      Malignant œdema ;  Acute emphysematous  or  gas gangrene ;      Cancrum oris ,  etc .Bed-sores:  Acute ;  chronic .Gangrene or mortification is the process by which a portion of tissue dies  en masse , as distinguished from the molecular or cellular death which constitutes ulceration.The dead portion is known as a  slough ."
Dry Gangrene|Dry Gangrene  or  Mummification  is a comparatively slow form of local death due, as a rule, to a diminution in the arterial blood supply of the affected part, resulting from such causes as the gradual narrowing of the lumen of the arteries by disease of their coats, or the blocking of the main vessel by an embolus.As the fluids in the tissues are lost by evaporation the part becomes dry and shrivelled, and as the skin is usually intact, infection does not take place, or if it does, the want of moisture renders the part an unsuitable soil, and the organisms do not readily find a footing.Any spread of the process that may take place is chiefly influenced by the anatomical distribution of the blocked arteries, and is arrested as soon as it reaches an area rich in anastomotic vessels.The dead portion is then cast off, the irritation resulting from the contact of the dead with the still living tissue inducing the formation of granulations on the proximal side of the junction, and these by slowly eating into the dead portion produce a furrow the  line of demarcation  which gradually deepens until complete separation is effected.As the muscles and bones have a richer blood supply than the integument, the death of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of muscles and bone, with the result that the stump left after spontaneous separation is conical, the end of the bone projecting beyond the soft parts.Clinical Features.
Heat, Chemical Agents|Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.Severe  burns  and  scalds  may be followed by necrosis of tissue.So long as the parts are kept absolutely dry as, for example, by the picric acid method of treatment the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene; but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access, moist gangrene follows.Strong  chemical agents , such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of the lesions produced being like those of severe burns.The resulting sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which are long of healing.Carbolic Gangrene.
Carbolic Gangrene|Carbolic Gangrene.Carbolic acid, even in comparatively weak solution, is liable to induce dry gangrene when applied as a fomentation to a finger, especially in women and children.Thrombosis occurs in the blood vessels of the part, which at first is pale and soft, but later becomes dark and leathery.On account of the anasthetic action of carbolic acid, the onset of the process is painless, and the patient does not realise his danger.A line of demarcation soon forms, but the dead part separates very slowly.Gangrene from Frost-bite.
Spasm of Blood Vessels|Gangrene associated with Spasm of Blood Vessels.Raynaud's Disease , or symmetrical gangrene, is supposed to be due to spasm of the arterioles, resulting from peripheral neuritis.It occurs oftenest in women, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, who are the subjects of uterine disorders, anamia, or chlorosis.Cold is an aggravating factor, as the disease is commonest during the winter months.The digits of both hands or the toes of both feet are simultaneously attacked, and the disease seldom spreads beyond the phalanges or deeper than the skin.The first evidence is that the fingers become cold, white, and insensitive to touch and pain.
Clinical Varieties|Clinical Varieties of Bacillary Gangrene.Acute infective gangrene  is the form most commonly met with in civil practice.It may follow such trivial injuries as a pin-prick or a scratch, the signs of acute cellulitis rapidly giving place to those of a spreading gangrene.Or it may ensue on a severe railway, machinery, or street accident, when lacerated and bruised tissues are contaminated with gross dirt.Often within a few hours of the injury the whole part rapidly becomes painful, swollen, œdematous, and tense.The skin is at first glazed, and perhaps paler than normal, but soon assumes a dull red or purplish hue, and bulla form on the surface.Clinical Varieties of Tetanus.Acute  or  Fulminating Tetanus .This variety is characterised by the shortness of the incubation period, the rapidity of its progress, the severity of its symptoms, and its all but universally fatal issue in spite of treatment, death taking place in from one to four days.The characteristic symptoms may appear within three or four days of the infliction of the wound, but the incubation period may extend to three weeks, and the wound may be quite healed before the disease declares itself  delayed tetanus .Usually, however, the wound is inflamed and suppurating, with ragged and sloughy edges.A slight feverish attack may mark the onset of the tetanic condition, or the patient may feel perfectly well until the spasms begin.Clinical Varieties of Anthrax.In man, anthrax may manifest itself in one of three clinical forms.It may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a diseased animal to those who, by their occupation or otherwise, are brought into contact with it for example, shepherds, butchers, veterinary surgeons, or hide-porters.Infection may occur on the face by the use of a shaving-brush contaminated by spores.The path of infection is usually through an abrasion of the skin, and the primary manifestations are local, constituting what is known as  the malignant pustule .In other cases the disease is contracted through the inhalation of the dried spores into the respiratory passages.
Gas Gangrene|Acute Emphysematous  or  Gas Gangrene  was prevalent in certain areas at various periods during the European War.It follows infection of lacerated wounds with the  bacillus arogenes capsulatus , usually in combination with other anaërobes, and its main incidence is on the muscles, which rapidly become infiltrated with gas that spreads throughout the whole extent of the muscle, disintegrating its fibres and leading to necrosis.The gangrenous process spreads with appalling rapidity, the limb becoming enormously swollen, painful, and crepitant or even tympanitic.Patches of coppery or purple colour appear on the skin, and bulla containing blood-stained serum form on the surface.The toxamia is profound, and the face and lips assume a characteristic cyanosis.The condition is attended with a high mortality.
Excoriations|Excoriations, which may develop into true bed-sores, sometimes form where two skin surfaces remain constantly apposed, as in the region of the scrotum or labium, under pendulous mamma, or between fingers or toes confined in a splint.Clinical Features.Two clinical varieties are met with the acute and the chronic bed-sore.The  acute  bed-sore usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock.It develops rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain brain diseases.The part affected becomes red and congested, while the surrounding parts are œdematous and swollen, blisters form, and the skin loses its vitality (Fig.
the anti-streptococcic serum|It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the proper strain of streptococcus.It is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are rigidly carried out.DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.
Klebs-Löffler|DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.Clinical Features.In  pharyngeal diphtheria , on the first or second day of the disease, redness and swelling of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, tonsils, and palate are well marked, and small, circular greenish or grey patches of false membrane, composed of necrosed epithelium, fibrin, leucocytes, and red blood corpuscles, begin to appear.The finding of the Klebs-Löffler bacillus is the only conclusive evidence of the disease.The bacillus may be obtained by swabbing the throat with a piece of aseptic not antiseptic cotton wool or clean linen rag held in a pair of forceps, and rotated so as to entangle portions of the false membrane or exudate.The swab thus obtained is placed in a test-tube, previously sterilised by having had some water boiled in it, and sent to a laboratory for investigation.To identify the bacillus a piece of the membrane from the swab is rubbed on a cover glass, dried, and stained with methylene blue or other basic stain; or cultures may be made on agar or other suitable medium.When a bacteriological examination is impossible, or when the clinical features do not coincide with the results obtained, the patient should always be treated on the assumption that he suffers from diphtheria.So much doubt exists as to the real nature of membranous croup and its relationship to true diphtheria, that when the diagnosis between the two is uncertain the safest plan is to treat the case as one of diphtheria.
s. Veterinary|
ronic variety|In man , acute glanders is commoner than the chronic variety.Infection always takes place through an abraded surface, and usually on one of the uncovered parts of the body most commonly the skin of the hands, arms, or face; or on the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eye.The disease has been acquired by accidental inoculation in the course of experimental investigations in the laboratory, and proved fatal.The incubation period is from three to five days.The  local  manifestations are pain and swelling in the region of the infected wound, with inflammatory redness around it and along the lines of the superficial lymphatics.In the course of a week, small, firm nodules appear, and are rapidly transformed into pustules.In man  also the clinical features of the chronic variety of the disease are somewhat different from those of the acute form.Here, too, infection takes place through a broken cutaneous surface, and leads to a superficial lymphangitis with nodular thickening of the lymphatics ( farcy buds ).The neighbouring glands soon become swollen and indurated.The primary lesion meanwhile inflames, suppurates, and, after breaking down, leaves a large, irregular ulcer with thickened edges and a foul, purulent or bloody discharge.The glands break down in the same way, and lead to wide destruction of skin, and the resulting sinuses and ulcers are exceedingly intractable.Secondary deposits in the subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, and other parts, are not uncommon, and the nasal mucous membrane may become involved.
Artificial Hyperamia|Artificial Hyperamia.When such direct means as the above are impracticable, much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by improving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area, so as to ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it.The beneficial effects of  hot fomentations and poultices  depend on their causing a dilatation of the vessels, and so inducing a hyperamia in the affected area.It has been shown experimentally that repeated, short applications of moist heat (not exceeding 106° F.) are more efficacious than continuous application.It is now believed that the so-called  counter-irritants  mustard, iodine, cantharides, actual cautery act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by applying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based on the same principle.While these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years that their mode of action has been properly understood, and to August Bier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a scientific and rational basis.Artificial Hyperamia.As has been explained, the induction of hyperamia by the method devised by Bier, constitutes one of our most efficient means of combating bacterial infection.The treatment of tuberculosis on this plan has been proved by experience to be a valuable addition to our therapeutic measures, and the simplicity of its application has led to its being widely adopted in practice.It results in an increase in the reactive changes around the tuberculous focus, an increase in the immigration of leucocytes, and infiltration with the lymphocytes.The constricting bandage should be applied at some distance above the seat of infection; for instance, in disease of the wrist, it is put on above the elbow, and it must not cause pain either where it is applied or in the diseased part.The bandage is only applied for a few hours each day, either two hours at a time or twice a day for one hour, and, while it is on, all dressings are removed save a piece of sterile gauze over any wound or sinus that may be present.
Beck of Chicago|It was found by Beck of Chicago that the injection of bismuth paste is frequently followed by healing of the sinus, and that, if one injection fails to bring about a cure, repeating the injection every second day may be successful.Some caution must be observed in this treatment, as symptoms of poisoning have been observed to follow its use.If they manifest themselves, an injection of warm olive oil should be given; the oil, left in for twelve hours or so, forms an emulsion with the bismuth, which can be withdrawn by aspiration.Iodoform suspended in glycerin may be employed in a similar manner.When these and other non-operative measures fail, and the whole track of the sinus is accessible, it should be laid open, scraped, and packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze until it heals from the bottom.The  tuberculous ulcer  is described in the chapter on ulcers.
SYPHILIS Transmission  Clinical|INHERITED     SYPHILIS Transmission  Clinical features in infancy, in later     life  Contagiousness Treatment.Syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a specific virus.It is nearly always communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion being the medium through which the virus is transmitted, and the seat of inoculation is almost invariably a surface covered by squamous epithelium.The disease was unknown in Europe before the year 1493, when it was introduced into Spain by Columbus' crew, who were infected in Haiti, where the disease had been endemic from time immemorial (Bloch).The granulation tissue which forms as a result of the reaction of the tissues to the presence of the virus is chiefly composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with an abundant new formation of capillary blood vessels.Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells, which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are practically absent.
endothelioid|Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells, which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are practically absent.When syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the condition is spoken of as  acquired syphilis , and the first visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation, and is known as  the primary lesion .Those who have thus acquired the disease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer from  inherited syphilis .The Virus of Syphilis.The cause of syphilis, whether acquired or inherited, is the organism, described by Schaudinn and Hoffman, in 1905, under the name of  spirochata pallida  or  spironema pallidum .It is a delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 µ and in width about 0.25 µ, and is distinguished from other spirochates by its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same during rest and in active movement (Fig.

Keogh Murphy, Oxford Medical Publications.The Soft Sore, Soft Chancre, or Chancroid.The differential diagnosis of syphilis necessitates the consideration of the  soft sore ,  soft chancre , or  chancroid , which is also a common form of venereal disease, and is due to infection with a virulent pus-forming bacillus, first described by Ducrey in 1889.Ducrey's bacillus occurs in the form of minute oval rods measuring about 1.5 µ in length, which stain readily with any basic aniline dye, but are quickly decolorised by Gram's method.They are found mixed with other organisms in the purulent discharge from the sore, and are chiefly arranged in small groups or in short chains.Soft sores are always contracted by direct contact from another individual, and the incubation period is a short one of from two to five days.

fourchette|They are usually situated in the vicinity of the franum, and, in women, about the labia minora or fourchette; they probably originate in abrasions in these situations.They appear as pustules, which are rapidly converted into small, acutely inflamed ulcers with sharply cut, irregular margins, which bleed easily and yield an abundant yellow purulent discharge.They are devoid of the induration of syphilis, are painful, and nearly always multiple, reproducing themselves in successive crops by auto-inoculation.Soft sores are often complicated by phimosis and balanitis, and they frequently lead to infection of the glands in the groin.The resulting bubo is ill-defined, painful, and tender, and suppuration occurs in about one-fourth of the cases.The overlying skin becomes adherent and red, and suppuration takes place either in the form of separate foci in the interior of the individual glands, or around them; in the latter case, on incision, the glands are found lying bathed in pus.
Condylomata|Condylomata  are more characteristic of syphilis than any other type of skin lesion.They are papules occurring on those parts of the body where the skin is habitually moist, and especially where two skin surfaces are in contact.They are chiefly met with on the external genitals, especially in women, around the anus, beneath large pendulous mamma, between the toes, and at the angles of the mouth, and in these situations their development is greatly favoured by neglect of cleanliness.They present the appearance of well-defined circular or ovoid areas in which the skin is thickened and raised above the surface; they are covered with a white sodden epidermis, and furnish a scanty but very infective discharge.Under the influence of irritation and want of rest, as at the anus or at the angle of the mouth, they are apt to become fissured and superficially ulcerated, and the discharge then becomes abundant and may crust on the surface, forming yellow scabs.At the angle of the mouth the condylomatous patches may spread to the cheek, and when they ulcerate may leave fissure-like scars radiating from the mouth an appearance best seen in inherited syphilis (Fig.
The Affections of the Eyes|The Affections of the Eyes , although fortunately rare, are of great importance because of the serious results which may follow if they are not recognised and treated.Iritis  is the commonest of these, and may occur in one or in both eyes, one after the other, from three to eight months after infection.The patient complains of impairment of sight and of frontal or supraorbital pain.The eye waters and is hypersensitive, the iris is discoloured and reacts sluggishly to light, and there is a zone of ciliary congestion around the cornea.The appearance of minute white nodules or flakes of lymph at the margin of the pupil is especially characteristic of syphilitic iritis.When adhesions have formed between the iris and the structures in relation to it, the pupil dilates irregularly under atropin.
Serum Diagnosis Wassermann Reaction|Serum Diagnosis Wassermann Reaction.Wassermann found that if an extract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochates is mixed with the serum from a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed.The application of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried out by an expert pathologist.For the purpose he is supplied with from 5 c.c.to 10 c.c.of the patient's blood, withdrawn under aseptic conditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and transferred to a clean and dry glass tube.
The Administration of Mercury|The Administration of Mercury.The success of the arsenical preparations has diminished the importance of mercury in the treatment of syphilis, but it is still used to supplement the effect of the injections.The amount of mercury to be given in any case must be proportioned to the idiosyncrasies of the patient, and it is advisable, before commencing the treatment, to test his urine and record his body-weight.The small amount of mercury given at the outset is gradually increased.If the body-weight falls, or if the gums become sore and the breath foul, the mercury should be stopped for a time.If salivation occurs, the drinking of hot water and the taking of hot baths should be insisted upon, and half-dram doses of the alkaline sulphates prescribed.
grey powder|"This was for long the most popular method in this country, the preparation usually employed being grey powder, in pills or tablets, each of which contains one grain of the powder.Three of these are given daily in the first instance, and the daily dose is increased to five or even seven grains till the standard for the individual patient is arrived at.As the grey powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be combined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg.c. cret.gr.1; ferri sulph.As the grey powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be combined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg.c. cret.gr.1; ferri sulph.exsiccat.gr.In doubtful cases, the diagnosis may be aided by the Wassermann test and by noting the therapeutic effects of grey powder, which, in syphilitic infants, usually effects a marked and rapid improvement both in the symptoms and in the general health.While a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may therefore be described as  permanent signs of the inherited disease : Dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded; radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction of the hard palate; Hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis; deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata; ""sabre-blade"" or other deformity of the tibia.The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.In 1837, Colles of Dublin stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the disease.This doctrine, which is known as  Colles' law , is generally accepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.The older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the disease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as it does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis."
The General Health|The General Health.The patient must lead a regular life and cultivate the fresh-air habit, which is as beneficial in syphilis as in tuberculosis.Anamia, malaria, and other sources of debility must receive appropriate treatment.The diet should be simple and easily digested, and should include a full supply of milk.Alcohol is prohibited.The excretory organs are encouraged to act by the liberal drinking of hot water between meals, say five or six tumblerfuls in the twenty-four hours.
The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage|The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage.Before the introduction of the Ehrlich-Hata treatment no patient was allowed to marry until three years had elapsed after the disappearance of the last manifestation.While marriage might be entered upon under these conditions without risk of the husband infecting the wife, the possibility of his conveying the disease to the offspring cannot be absolutely excluded.It is recommended, as a precautionary measure, to give a further mercurial course of two or three months' duration before marriage, and an intravenous injection of an arsenical preparation.Intermediate Stage.After the dying away of the secondary manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the patient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called  reminders .
Tertiary Syphilis|Tertiary Syphilis.While the manifestations of primary and secondary syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.It is to be borne in mind that in a certain proportion of men and in a larger proportion of women, the patient has no knowledge of having suffered from syphilis.Certain slight but important signs may give the clue in a number of cases, such as irregularity of the pupils or failure to react to light, abnormality of the reflexes, and the discovery of patches of leucoplakia on the tongue, cheek, or palate.The  general character of tertiary manifestations  may be stated as follows: They attack by preference the tissues derived from the mesoblastic layer of the embryo the cellular tissue, bones, muscles, and viscera.They are often localised to one particular tissue or organ, such, for example, as the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the bones, or the liver, and they are rarely symmetrical.
spirochates|"It is a delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 µ and in width about 0.25 µ, and is distinguished from other spirochates by its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same during rest and in active movement (Fig.36).In a fresh specimen, such as a scraping from a hard chancre suspended in a little salt solution, it shows active movements.The organism is readily destroyed by heat, and perishes in the absence of moisture.It has been proved experimentally that it remains infective only up to six hours after its removal from the body.Noguchi has succeeded in obtaining pure cultures from the infected tissues of the rabbit.Noguchi has made an emulsion of dead spirochates which he calls  luetin , and which gives a specific reaction resembling that of tuberculin in tuberculosis, a papule or a pustule forming at the site of the intra-dermal injection.It is said to be most efficacious in the tertiary and latent forms of syphilis, which are precisely those forms in which the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties.ACQUIRED SYPHILIS In the vast majority of cases, infection takes place during the congress of the sexes.Delicate, easily abraded surfaces are then brought into contact, and the discharge from lesions containing the virus is placed under favourable conditions for conveying the disease from one person to the other.In the male the possibility of infection taking place is increased if the virus is retained under cover of a long and tight prepuce, and if there are abrasions on the surface with which it comes in contact.The frequency with which infection takes place on the genitals during sexual intercourse warrants syphilis being considered a venereal disease, although there are other ways in which it may be contracted.Wassermann found that if an extract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochates is mixed with the serum from a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed.The application of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried out by an expert pathologist.For the purpose he is supplied with from 5 c.c.to 10 c.c.of the patient's blood, withdrawn under aseptic conditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and transferred to a clean and dry glass tube.There is abundant evidence that the Wassermann test is a reliable means of establishing a diagnosis of syphilis.As the presence of the reaction is an evidence of the activity of the spirochates, repeated applications of the test furnish a valuable means of estimating the efficacy of treatment.The object aimed at is to change a persistently positive reaction to a permanently negative one.Treatment of Syphilis.In the treatment of syphilis the two main objects are to maintain the general health at the highest possible standard, and to introduce into the system therapeutic agents which will inhibit or destroy the invading parasite.The second of these objects has been achieved by the researches of Ehrlich, who, in conjunction with his pupil, Hata, has built up a compound, the dihydrochloride of dioxydiamido-arseno-benzol, popularly known as salvarsan or ""606.""Other preparations, such as kharsivan, arseno-billon, and diarsenol, are chemically equivalent to salvarsan, containing from 27 to 31 per cent.Observations show that the spirochates lose their capacity for movement within an hour or two of the administration, and usually disappear altogether in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours.Wassermann's reaction usually yields a negative result in from three weeks to two months, but later may again become positive.Subsequent doses of the arsenical preparation are therefore usually indicated, and should be given in from 7 to 21 days according to the dose.When syphilis occurs in a  pregnant woman , she should be given in the early months an ordinary course of ""914,"" followed by 10-grain doses of potassium iodide twice daily.The injections may be repeated two months later, and during the remainder of the pregnancy 2-grain mercury pills are given twice daily (A. Campbell).The presence of albumen in the urine contra-indicates arsenical treatment.Both the gummatous lesions and the fibrosis of tertiary syphilis are directly excited by the spirochates.The life-history of an untreated gumma varies with its environment.When protected from injury and irritation in the substance of an internal organ such as the liver, it may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue, and persist in this condition for an indefinite period, or it may be absorbed and leave in its place a fibrous cicatrix.In the interior of a long bone it may replace the rigid framework of the shaft to such an extent as to lead to pathological fracture.If it is near the surface of the body as, for example, in the subcutaneous or submucous cellular tissue, or in the periosteum of a superficial bone, such as the palate, the skull, or the tibia the tissue of which it is composed is apt to undergo necrosis, in which the overlying skin or mucous membrane frequently participates, the result being an ulcer the tertiary syphilitic ulcer (Figs.40 and 41)."
Choroiditis|Choroiditis  and  retinitis  may also occur, and leave permanent changes easily recognised on examination with the ophthalmoscope.Among the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be mentioned gummatous disease in the  larynx and trachea , attended with ulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the  nervous system  which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.In a limited number of cases, about the period of puberty there may develop  deafness , which is usually bilateral and may become absolute.Changes in the Permanent Teeth.These affect specially the upper central incisors, which are dwarfed and stand somewhat apart in the gum, with their free edges converging towards one another.They are tapering or peg-shaped, and present at their cutting margin a deep semilunar notch.
condylomata|"It is readily found in the mucous patches and condylomata of the secondary period.It is best stained by Giemsa's method, and its recognition is greatly aided by the use of the ultra-microscope.The spirochate has been demonstrated in every form of syphilitic lesion, and has been isolated from the blood with difficulty and from lymph withdrawn by a hollow needle from enlarged lymph glands.The saliva of persons suffering from syphilitic lesions of the mouth also contains the organism.In tertiary lesions there is greater difficulty in demonstrating the spirochate, but small numbers have been found in the peripheral parts of gummata and in the thickened patches in syphilitic disease of the aorta.Noguchi and Moore have discovered the spirochate in the brain in a number of cases of general paralysis of the insane.The primary lesion may take the form of condylomata.Indurated œdema, with brownish-red or livid discoloration of one or both labia, is diagnostic of syphilis.The hard chancre is usually solitary, but sometimes there are two or more; when there are several, they are individually smaller than the solitary chancre.It is the exception for a hard chancre to leave a visible scar, hence, in examining patients with a doubtful history of syphilis, little reliance can be placed on the presence or absence of a scar on the genitals.When the primary lesion has taken the form of an open ulcer with purulent discharge, or has sloughed, there is a permanent scar.Infection of the adjacent lymph glands  is usually found to have taken place by the time the primary lesion has acquired its characteristic induration.In the treatment of condylomata the greatest attention must be paid to cleanliness and dryness.After washing and drying the affected patches, they are dusted with a powder consisting of equal parts of calomel and carbonate of zinc; and apposed skin surfaces, such as the nates or labia, are separated by sublimate wool.In the ulcers of later secondary syphilis, crusts are got rid of in the first instance by means of a boracic poultice, after which a piece of lint or gauze cut to the size of the ulcer and soaked in black wash is applied and covered with oil-silk.If the ulcer tends to spread in area or in depth, it should be scraped with a sharp spoon, and painted over with acid nitrate of mercury, or a local hyperamia may be induced by Klapp's suction apparatus.In lesions of the mouth and throat , the teeth should be attended to; the best local application is a solution of chromic acid 10 grains to the ounce painted on with a brush once daily.If this fails, the lesions may be dusted with calomel the last thing at night.At the anus the papules acquire the characters of  condylomata , also at the angles of the mouth, where they often ulcerate and leave radiating scars.Affections of the Mucous Membranes.The inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane that causes snuffles has already been referred to.There may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a stomatitis which is of importance, because it results in interference with the development of the permanent teeth.The mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat of mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child's cry is hoarse.Affections of the Bones.When, however, the rash is scanty or is obscured by co-existing eczema, most reliance should be placed on the distribution of the eruption, on the brown stains which are left after it has passed off, on the presence of condylomata, and of fissuring and scarring at the angles of the mouth.The history of the mother relative to repeated miscarriages and still-born children may afford confirmatory evidence.In doubtful cases, the diagnosis may be aided by the Wassermann test and by noting the therapeutic effects of grey powder, which, in syphilitic infants, usually effects a marked and rapid improvement both in the symptoms and in the general health.While a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may therefore be described as  permanent signs of the inherited disease : Dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded; radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction of the hard palate; Hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis; deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata; ""sabre-blade"" or other deformity of the tibia.The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.In 1837, Colles of Dublin stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the disease."

Bland Sutton|An odontoma is composed of dental tissues in varying proportions and different degrees of development, arising from tooth-germs or from teeth still in process of growth (Bland Sutton).Odontomas resemble teeth in so far that during their development they remain hidden below the mucous membrane and give no evidence of their existence.There then succeeds, usually between the twentieth and twenty-fifth years, an eruptive stage, which is often attended with suppuration, and this may be the means of drawing attention to the tumour.Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their formation.The  epithelial odontoma  is derived from persistent portions of the epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible.The cystic spaces of the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid.Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their formation.The  epithelial odontoma  is derived from persistent portions of the epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible.The cystic spaces of the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid.These tumours have been described by Eve under the name of multilocular cystic epithelial tumours of the jaw.The  follicular odontoma , also known as a  dentigerous cyst , is derived from the distension of a tooth follicle.It constitutes a cyst containing a viscid fluid, and an imperfectly formed tooth is often found embedded in its wall.
Fibromatosis|"Diffuse fibroma  or  Fibromatosis , analogous to lipomatosis, is met with in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and constitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met with in the stomach and colon.Myxoma.A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous, semifluid consistence.The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and clinically resembles the lipoma.Myxomatous tissue is, however, frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.Myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the ""innocent parotid tumour.""Diffuse or Generalised Neuro-Fibromatosis Recklinghausen's Disease.These terms are now used to include what were formerly known as ""multiple neuromata,"" as well as certain other overgrowths related to nerves.The essential lesion is an overgrowth of the endoneural connective tissue throughout the nerves of both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems.The nerves are diffusely and unequally thickened, so that small twigs may become enlarged to the size of the median, while at irregular intervals along their course the connective-tissue overgrowth is exaggerated so as to form tumour-like swellings similar to the trunk-neuroma already described.The tumours, which vary greatly in size and number as many as a thousand have been counted in one case are enclosed in a capsule derived from the perineurium.The fibromatosis may also affect the cranial nerves, the ganglia on the posterior nerve roots, the nerves within the vertebral canal, and the sympathetic nerves and ganglia, as well as the continuations of the motor nerves within the muscles."
semifluid consistence|"A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous, semifluid consistence.The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and clinically resembles the lipoma.Myxomatous tissue is, however, frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.Myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the ""innocent parotid tumour.""Mucous polypus of the nose, which is often described as a myxoma, is merely a pendulous process of œdematous mucous membrane.Myeloma."
Rhabdomyoma|The  Rhabdomyoma  is an extremely rare form of tumour, met with in the kidney, uterus, and testicle.It contains striped muscle fibres, and is supposed to originate from a residue of muscular tissue which has become sequestrated during development.Glioma.A glioma is a tumour composed of neuroglia.It is met with exclusively in the central nervous system, retina, and optic nerve.It is a slowly growing, soft, ill-defined tumour, which displaces the adjacent nerve centres and nerve tracts, and is liable to become the seat of hamorrhage and thus to give rise to pressure symptoms resembling apoplexy.
Endotheliomas|Endotheliomas  take origin from the endothelium of lymph vessels and blood vessels, and serous cavities.They show great variation in type, partly because of the number of different kinds of endothelium from which they are derived, and partly because the new connective tissue which is formed is liable to undergo transformation into other tissues.They may be soft or hard, solid or cystic, diffuse or circumscribed; they grow very slowly, and are almost always innocent, although recurrence has been occasionally observed.Cases of multiple endotheliomata of the skin have recently been described by Wise.Angioma ,  lymphangioma , and  neuroma  are described with the disease of the individual tissues.MALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS SARCOMA The term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which exhibits malignant characters.
The Contagiousness of Cancer|The Contagiousness of Cancer.A limited number of cases are on record in which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from the lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the tongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being all examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or frequently in contact.The transference of cancer from one human being to another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding his finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction of a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known to occur.It is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence takes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent nodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of stitches in its neighbourhood.In the lower animals the grafting of cancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a cancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but only in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was taken.While cancer cannot be regarded as either contagious or infectious, it is important to bear in mind the possibility of infection of a wound with cancer when operating for the disease.
Implantati|Cysts:  Retention ,      Exudation ,  Implantation ,  Parasitic ,  Lymphatic or Serous .Ganglion.For the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book of pathology.A tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly formed tissue which fulfils no physiological function.Tumours increase in size quite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural termination to their growth.They are to be distinguished from such over-growths as are of the nature of simple hypertrophy or local giantism, and also from inflammatory swellings, which usually develop under the influence of a definite cause, have a natural termination, and tend to disappear when the cause ceases to act.Implantation cysts  are caused by the accidental transference of portions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may occur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns.The implanted epidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst.They are met with chiefly on the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea to a cherry.The treatment consists in removing them by dissection.Parasitic cysts  are produced by the growth within the tissues of cyst-forming parasites, the best known being the tania echinococcus, which gives rise to the  hydatid cyst .The liver is by far the most common site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.
Ganglionic|Ganglionic cysts are met with in other situations than those mentioned, but they are so rare as not to require separate description.Ganglia are to be diagnosed by their situation and physical characters; enlarged bursa, synovial cysts, and new-growths are the swellings most likely to be mistaken for them.The diagnosis is sometimes only cleared up by withdrawing the clear, jelly-like contents through a hollow needle.Pathological Anatomy.The wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous tissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so that it cannot be shelled out.There is no endothelial lining, and the fibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid material in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of degeneration from the surrounding connective tissue.
Lacerated Wounds|Contused and Lacerated Wounds.These may be considered together, as they so occur in practice.They are produced by crushing, biting, or tearing forms of violence such as result from machinery accidents, firearms, or the bites of animals.In addition to the irregular wound of the integument, there is always more or less bruising of the parts beneath and around, and the subcutaneous lesions are much wider than appears on the surface.Wounds of this variety usually gape considerably, especially when there is much laceration of the skin.It is not uncommon to have considerable portions of skin, muscle, or tendon completely torn away.
Cicatricial|"﻿CHAPTER I REPAIR

Introduction Process of repair Healing by primary union Granulation     tissue Cicatricial tissue Modifications of process of     repair Repair in individual tissues Transplantation or grafting     of tissues Conditions Sources of grafts Grafting of individual     tissues Methods.INTRODUCTION To prolong human life and to alleviate suffering are the ultimate objects of scientific medicine.The two great branches of the healing art Medicine and Surgery are so intimately related that it is impossible to draw a hard-and-fast line between them, but for convenience Surgery may be defined as ""the art of treating lesions and malformations of the human body by manual operations, mediate and immediate.""To apply his art intelligently and successfully, it is essential that the surgeon should be conversant not only with the normal anatomy and physiology of the body and with the various pathological conditions to which it is liable, but also with the nature of the process by which repair of injured or diseased tissues is effected.Without this knowledge he is unable to recognise such deviations from the normal as result from mal-development, injury, or disease, or rationally to direct his efforts towards the correction or removal of these.PROCESS OF REPAIR The process of repair in living tissue depends upon an inherent power possessed by vital cells of reacting to the irritation caused by injury or disease.Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries, until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by cicatricial tissue.In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated, and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction  cicatricial contraction .Healing of Epidermis.(5) Cicatricial contraction.(6) Gangrene, which may follow occlusion of main vessels, or virulent infective processes.(7) It is not uncommon to have particles of carbon embedded in the tissues after lacerated wounds, leaving unsightly, pigmented scars.This is often seen in coal-miners, and in those injured by firearms, and is to be prevented by removing all gross dirt from the edges of the wound.Treatment.In severe wounds of this class implicating the extremities, the most important question that arises is whether or not the limb can be saved."
Rifle Bullets|Wounds by Rifle Bullets.The vast majority of wounds inflicted by rifle bullets are met with in the field during active warfare, and fall to be treated by military surgeons.They occasionally occur accidentally, however, during range practice for example, and may then come under the notice of the civil surgeon.It is only necessary here to consider the effects of modern small-bore rifle or machine-gun bullets.The trajectory is practically flat up to 675 yards.In destructive effect there is not much difference between the various high velocity bullets used in different armies; they will kill up to a distance of two miles.
hypodermically|"A full dose of morphin is given hypodermically.The ampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents are poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is applied.In extensive wounds, the ""shell-dressing"" carried by the stretcher bearers is preferred.All bandages are applied loosely to allow for subsequent swelling.The fragments of fractured bones are immobilised by some form of emergency splint.2.In some cases hyoscin (1/200 grain) injected hypodermically is found efficacious when all other means have failed, but this drug must be used with great discrimination.The patient must be encouraged to take plenty of easily digested fluid food, supplemented, if necessary, by nutrient enemata and saline infusions.In the early stage a brisk mercurial purge is often of value.Alcohol should be withheld, unless failing of the pulse strongly indicates its use, and then it should be given along with the food.A delirious patient must be constantly watched by a trained attendant or other competent person, lest he get out of bed and do harm to himself or others.Mechanical restraint is often necessary, but must be avoided if possible, as it is apt to increase the excitement and exhaust the patient."
the Field Ambulance or|In the Field Ambulance or Casualty Clearing Station  further measures are employed for the relief of shock, and urgent operations are performed, such as amputation for gangrene, tracheotomy for dyspnœa, or laparotomy for perforated or lacerated intestine.In the majority of cases the main object is to guard against infection; the skin is disinfected over a wide area and surrounded with towels; damaged tissue, especially muscle, is removed with the knife or scissors, and foreign bodies are extracted.Torn blood vessels, and, if possible, nerves and tendons are repaired.The wound is then partly closed, provision being made for free drainage, or some special method of irrigation, such as that of Carrel, is adopted.Sometimes the wound is treated with bismuth, iodoform, and paraffin paste (B.I.P.P.)and sutured.
the Base Hospital|In the Base Hospital or Hospital Ship  various measures may be called for according to the progress of the wound and the condition of the patient.Shell Wounds and Wounds produced by Explosions.It is convenient to consider together the effects of the bursting of shells fired from heavy ordnance and those resulting in the course of blasting operations from the discharge of dynamite or other explosives, or from the bursting of steam boilers or pipes, the breaking of machinery, and similar accidents met with in civil practice.Wounds inflicted by shell fragments and shrapnel bullets tend to be extensive in area, and show great contusion, laceration, and destruction of the tissues.The missiles frequently lodge and carry portions of the clothing and, it may be, articles from the man's pocket, with them.Shell wounds are attended with a considerable degree of shock.
Burns of Second Degree Vesication of the Skin|Burns of Second Degree Vesication of the Skin.These are characterised by the occurrence of vesicles or blisters which are scattered over the hyperamic area, and contain a clear yellowish or brownish fluid.On removing the raised epidermis, the congested and highly sensitive papilla of the skin are exposed.Unna has found that pyogenic bacteria are invariably present in these blisters.Burns of the second degree leave no scar but frequently a persistent discoloration.In rare instances the burned area becomes the seat of a peculiar overgrowth of fibrous tissue of the nature of keloid (p 401).
Burns of Third Degree Partial Destruction of the Skin|Burns of Third Degree Partial Destruction of the Skin.The epidermis and papilla are destroyed in patches, leaving hard, dry, and insensitive sloughs of a yellow or black colour.The pain in these burns is intense, but passes off during the first or second day, to return again, however, when, about the end of a week, the sloughs separate and expose the nerve filaments of the underlying skin.Granulations spring up to fill the gap, and are rapidly covered by epithelium, derived partly from the margins and partly from the remains of skin glands which have not been completely destroyed.These latter appear on the surface of the granulations as small bluish islets which gradually increase in size, become of a greyish-white colour, and ultimately blend with one another and with the edges.The resulting cicatrix may be slightly depressed, but otherwise exhibits little tendency to contract and cause deformity.
X-Rays and Radium|INJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY  Injuries produced by Exposure to X-Rays and Radium.In the routine treatment of disease by radiations, injury is sometimes done to the tissues, even when the greatest care is exercised as to dosage and frequency of application.Robert Knox describes the following ill-effects.Acute dermatitis  varying in degree from a slight erythema to deep ulceration or even necrosis of skin.When ulcers form they are extremely painful and slow to heal.When hair-bearing areas are affected, epilation may occur without destroying the hair follicles and the hairs are reproduced, but if the reaction is excessive permanent alopecia may result.
Lister's work Means|"CHAPTER XII METHODS OF WOUND TREATMENT

Varieties of wounds Modes of infection Lister's work Means taken to     prevent infection of wounds:  heat ;  chemical antiseptics ;      disinfection of hands ;  preparation of skin of patient ;      instruments ;  ligatures ;  dressings  Means taken to combat     infection:  purification ;  open-wound method .The surgeon is called upon to treat two distinct classes of wounds: (1) those resulting from injury or disease in which  the skin is already broken , or in which a communication with a mucous surface exists; and (2) those that he himself makes  through intact skin , no infected mucous surface being involved.Infection by bacteria must be assumed to have taken place in all wounds made in any other way than by the knife of the surgeon operating through unbroken skin.On this assumption the modern system of wound treatment is based.Pathogenic bacteria are so widely distributed, that in the ordinary circumstances of everyday life, no matter how trivial a wound may be, or how short a time it may remain exposed, the access of organisms to it is almost certain unless preventive measures are employed.It cannot be emphasised too strongly that rigid precautions are to be taken to exclude fresh infection, not only in dealing with wounds that are free of organisms, but equally in the management of wounds and other lesions that are already infected."
The Antiseptic System of Surgery|"The Antiseptic System of Surgery.Those who only know the surgical conditions of to-day can scarcely realise the state of matters which existed before the introduction of the antiseptic system by Joseph Lister in 1867.In those days few wounds escaped the ravages of pyogenic and other bacteria, with the result that suppuration ensued after most operations, and such diseases as erysipelas, pyamia, and ""hospital gangrene"" were of everyday occurrence.The mortality after compound fractures, amputations, and many other operations was appalling, and death from blood-poisoning frequently followed even the most trivial operations.An operation was looked upon as a last resource, and the inherent risk from blood-poisoning seemed to have set an impassable barrier to the further progress of surgery.To the genius of Lister we owe it that this barrier was removed."
Chemical Agents|Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.Severe  burns  and  scalds  may be followed by necrosis of tissue.So long as the parts are kept absolutely dry as, for example, by the picric acid method of treatment the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene; but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access, moist gangrene follows.Strong  chemical agents , such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of the lesions produced being like those of severe burns.The resulting sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which are long of healing.Carbolic Gangrene.Sterilisation by Chemical Agents.For the purification of the skin of the patient, the hands of the surgeon, and knives and other instruments that are damaged by heat, recourse must be had to chemical agents.These, however, are less reliable than heat, and are open to certain other objections.Disinfection of the Hands.It is now generally recognised that one of the most likely sources of wound infection is the hands of the surgeon and his assistants.It is only by carefully studying to avoid all contact with infective matter that the hands can be kept surgically pure, and that this source of wound infection can be reduced to a minimum.
Moschcowitz|Moschcowitz has found that the tensile strength of catgut so prepared is increased if it is kept dry in a sterile vessel, instead of being left indefinitely in the iodine solution.If Salkindsohn's formula is used tincture of iodine, 1 part; proof spirit, 15 parts the gut can be kept permanently in the solution without becoming brittle.To avoid contamination from the hands, catgut should be removed from the bottle with aseptic forceps and passed direct to the surgeon.Any portion unused should be thrown away.Silk  is prepared by being soaked for twelve hours in ether, for other twelve in alcohol, and then boiled for ten minutes in 1 in 1000 sublimate solution.It is then wound on spools with purified hands protected by sterilised gloves, and kept in absolute alcohol.

SYNCOPE SHOCK COLLAPSE FAT EMBOLISM TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA DELIRIUM     IN SURGICAL PATIENTS:  Delirium in general ;  Delirium tremens ;      Traumatic delirium .SYNCOPE, SHOCK, AND COLLAPSE Syncope, shock, and collapse are clinical conditions which, although depending on different causes, bear a superficial resemblance to one another.Syncope or Fainting.Syncope is the result of a suddenly produced anamia of the brain from temporary weakening or arrest of the heart's action.In surgical practice, this condition is usually observed in nervous persons who have been subjected to pain, as in the reduction of a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly lost a considerable quantity of blood.It may also follow the sudden withdrawal of fluid from a large cavity, as in tapping an abdomen for ascites, or withdrawing fluid from the pleural cavity."
Prevention of Operation Shock|"Prevention of Operation Shock.In the preparation of a patient for operation, drastic purgation and prolonged fasting must be avoided, and about half an hour before a severe operation a pint of saline solution should be slowly introduced into the rectum; this is repeated, if necessary, during the operation, and at its conclusion.The operating-room must be warm not less than 70° F. and the patient should be wrapped in cotton wool and blankets, and surrounded by hot-bottles.All lotions used must be warm (100° F.); and the operation should be completed as speedily and as bloodlessly as possible.The element of fear may to some extent be eliminated by the preliminary administration of such drugs as scopolamin or morphin, and with a view to preventing the passage of exciting afferent impulses, Crile advocates ""blocking"" of the nerves by the injection of a 1 per cent.solution of novocaine into their substance on the proximal side of the field of operation."
DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium|DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations.It may be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic infective diseases of the urinary organs.In the various forms of meningitis also, and in some cases of injury to the head, it is common; and it is sometimes met with after severe hamorrhage, and in cases of poisoning by such drugs as iodoform, cocain, or alcohol.Delirium may also, of course, be a symptom of insanity.Often there is merely incoherent muttering regarding past incidents or occupations, or about absent friends; or the condition may assume the form of excitement, of dementia, or of melancholia; and the symptoms are usually worst at night.Delirium Tremens  is seen in persons addicted to alcohol, who, as the result of accident or operation, are suddenly compelled to lie in bed.

Entrance of Air into Veins Air Embolism|Entrance of Air into Veins Air Embolism.This serious, though fortunately rare, accident is apt to occur in the course of operations in the region of the thorax, neck, or axilla, if a large vein is opened and fails to collapse on account of the rigidity of its walls, its incorporation in a dense fascia, or from traction being made upon it.If the wound in a vein is thus held open, the negative pressure during inspiration sucks air into the right side of the heart.This is accompanied by a hissing or gurgling sound, and with the next expiration some frothy blood escapes from the wound.The patient instantly becomes pale, the pupils dilate, respiration becomes laboured, and although the heart may continue to beat forcibly, the peripheral pulse is weak, and may even be imperceptible.On auscultating the heart, a churning sound may be heard.
the tunica externa retract|(b) If an artery is only  partly cut across , the divided fibres of the tunica muscularis contract and those of the tunica externa retract, with the result that a more or less circular hole is formed in the wall of the vessel, from which free bleeding takes place, as the conditions are unfavourable for the formation of an occluding clot.Even if a clot does form, when the blood-pressure rises it is readily displaced, leading to reactionary hamorrhage.Should the wound become infected, secondary hamorrhage is specially liable to occur.A further risk attends this form of injury, in that the intra-vascular tension may in time lead to gradual stretching of the scar tissue which closes the gap in the vessel wall, with the result that a localised dilatation or diverticulum forms, constituting a  traumatic aneurysm .(c) When the injury merely takes the form of a  puncture  or  small incision  a blood-clot forms between the edges, becomes organised, and is converted into cicatricial tissue which seals the aperture.Such wounds may also be followed by reactionary or secondary hamorrhage, or later by the formation of a traumatic aneurysm.
Continuity|Repair of a Vessel ligated in its Continuity.When a ligature is applied to an artery it should be pulled sufficiently tight to occlude the lumen without causing rupture of its coats.It often happens, however, that the compression causes rupture of the inner and middle coats, so that only the outer coat remains in the grasp of the ligature.While this weakens the wall of the vessel, it has the advantage of hastening coagulation, by bringing the blood into contact with damaged tissue.Whether the inner and middle coats are ruptured or not, blood coagulates both above and below the ligature, the proximal clot being longer and broader than that on the distal side.In small arteries these clots extend as far as the nearest collateral branch, but in the larger trunks their length varies.
Repair of Veins|Repair of Veins.The process of repair in veins is the same as that in arteries, but the thrombosed area may become canalised and the circulation through the vessel be re-established.HAMORRHAGE IN SURGICAL OPERATIONS The management of the hamorrhage which accompanies an operation includes (a) preventive measures, and (b) the arrest of the bleeding.Prevention of Hamorrhage.Whenever possible, hamorrhage should be controlled by  digital compression  of the main artery supplying the limb rather than by a tourniquet.If efficiently applied compression reduces the immediate loss of blood to a minimum, and the bleeding from small vessels that follows the removal of the tourniquet is avoided.
Hamostatics|Hamostatics  or  Styptics .The local application of hamostatics is seldom to be recommended.In the treatment of epistaxis or bleeding from the nose, of hamorrhage from the socket of a tooth, and sometimes from ulcerating or granulating surfaces, however, they may be useful.All clots must be removed and the drug applied directly to the bleeding surface.Adrenalin and turpentine are the most useful drugs for this purpose.Hamorrhage from bone, for example the skull, may be arrested by means of Horsley's aseptic plastic wax.
hamatemesis|In severe cases, and especially when the vomited matter resembles coffee-grounds from admixture with altered blood the so-called post-operative hamatemesis the best means of arresting the vomiting is by washing out the stomach.Thirst is relieved by rectal injections of saline solution.The introduction of saline solution into the veins or by the rectum is also useful in diluting and hastening the elimination of circulating toxins.In surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the temperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed.When severe or prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold sponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of drugs.Relief of Symptoms.The coughing up of blood from the lungs is known as  hamoptysis ; vomiting of blood from the stomach, as  hamatemesis ; the passage of black-coloured stools due to the presence of blood altered by digestion, as  melana ; and the passage of bloody urine, as  hamaturia .Hamorrhage is known as arterial, venous, or capillary, according to the nature of the vessel from which it takes place.In  arterial  hamorrhage the blood is bright red in colour, and escapes from the cardiac end of the divided vessel in pulsating jets synchronously with the systole of the heart.In vascular parts for example the face both ends of a divided artery bleed freely.The blood flowing from an artery may be dark in colour if the respiration is impeded.When the heart's action is weak and the blood tension low the flow may appear to be continuous and not in jets.Hamorrhage from the mucous membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations apparently also due to toxic causes and not to the operation gives rise to the so-called  post-operative hamatemesis .Constitutional Effects of Hamorrhage.The severity of the symptoms resulting from hamorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost.The sudden loss of a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous cavity for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen is attended with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin, especially of the face, feet, and hands.The skin is moist with a cold, clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead.The pulse becomes feeble, soft, and rapid, and the patient is dull and listless, and complains of extreme thirst.
HAMOPHILIA|"HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown.There is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the composition of the blood.The affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an affected family being liable to suffer.Its mode of transmission to individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency is transmitted through the female line.Thus the daughters of a father who is a bleeder, whilst they do not themselves suffer from the disease, transmit the tendency to their male offspring."
hamophilia|"It is well to remember that those who suffer from scurvy, or hamophilia (bleeders), and fat and anamic females, are liable to be bruised by comparatively trivial injuries.Clinical Features.The less severe forms of contusion are associated with  ecchymosis , numerous minute and discrete punctate hamorrhages being scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is slightly œdematous.The effused blood is soon reabsorbed.The more severe forms are attended with  extravasation , the extravasated blood being widely diffused through the cellular tissue of the part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of the orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest wall.A blue or bluish-black discoloration occurs in patches, varying in size and depth with the degree of force which produced the injury, and in shape with the instrument employed.This form of bleeding is serious in those who are the subjects of hamophilia.INJURIES OF ARTERIES The following description of the injuries of arteries refers to the larger, named trunks.The injuries of smaller, unnamed vessels are included in the consideration of wounds and contusions.Contusion.An artery may be contused by a blow or crush, or by the oblique impact of a bullet.The bruising of the vessel wall, especially if it is diseased, may result in the formation of a thrombus which occludes the lumen temporarily or even permanently, and in rare cases may lead to gangrene of the limb beyond.HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown.There is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the composition of the blood.The affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an affected family being liable to suffer.Its mode of transmission to individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency is transmitted through the female line.Thus the daughters of a father who is a bleeder, whilst they do not themselves suffer from the disease, transmit the tendency to their male offspring.Female members of hamophilia families sometimes show a tendency to excessive hamorrhage, but they seldom manifest the characteristic features met with in the male members.Sometimes the hamorrhage takes place apparently spontaneously from the gums, the nasal or the intestinal mucous membrane.In other cases the bleeding occurs into the cellular tissue under the skin or mucous membrane, producing large areas of ecchymosis and discoloration.One of the commonest manifestations of the disease is the occurrence of hamorrhage into the cavities of the large joints, especially the knee, elbow, or hip.The patient suffers repeatedly from such hamorrhages, the determining injury being often so slight as to have passed unobserved.There is evidence that the tendency to bleed is greater at certain times than at others in some cases showing almost a cyclical character although nothing is known as to the cause of the variation.This is a rare but characteristic affection met with chiefly in the knee-joint of boys who are the subjects of hamophilia.After some trivial injury, or even without apparent cause, a hamorrhage takes place into the joint.The joint is tensely swollen, cannot be completely extended, and is so painful that the patient is obliged to lie up.The temperature is often raised (101° to 102° F.), especially if there are also hamorrhages elsewhere.The blood in the joint is slowly re-absorbed, and by the end of a fortnight or so, the symptoms completely disappear.As a rule these attacks are repeated; the pain attending them diminishes, but the joint becomes the seat of permanent changes: the synovial membrane is thickened, abnormally vascular, and coloured brown from the deposit of blood pigment; on its surface, and in parts of the articular cartilage, there is a deposit of rust-coloured fibrin; there may be extensive adhesions, and in some cases changes occur like those observed in arthritis deformans with erosion and ulceration of the cartilage and a form of dry caries of the articular surfaces, which may terminate in ankylosis."
THROMBOSIS|THROMBOSIS AND EMBOLISM The processes known as thrombosis and embolism are so intimately associated with the diseases of blood vessels that it is convenient to define these terms in the first instance.Thrombosis.The term  thrombus  is applied to a clot of blood formed in the interior of the heart or of a blood vessel, and the process by which such a clot forms is known as  thrombosis .It would appear that slowing or stagnation of the blood-stream, and interference with the integrity of the lining membrane of the vessel wall, are the most important factors determining the formation of the clot.Alterations in the blood itself, such as occur, for example, in certain toxamias, also favour coagulation.When the thrombus is formed slowly, it consists of white blood cells with a small proportion of fibrin, and, being deposited in successive layers, has a distinctly laminated appearance on section.THROMBO-PHLEBITIS AND THROMBOSIS IN VEINS  Thrombosis  is more common in veins than in arteries, because slowing of the blood-stream and irritation of the endothelium of the vessel wall are, owing to the conditions of the venous circulation, more readily induced in veins.Venous thrombosis may occur from purely mechanical causes as, for example, when the wall of a vein is incised, or the vessel included in a ligature, or when it is bruised or crushed by a fragment of a broken bone or by a bandage too tightly applied.Under these conditions thrombosis is essentially a reparative process, and has already been considered in relation to the repair of blood vessels.In other cases thrombosis is associated with certain constitutional diseases gout, for example; the endothelium of the veins undergoing changes possibly the result of irritation by abnormal constituents in the blood which favour the formation of thrombi.Under these various conditions the formation of a thrombus is not necessarily associated with the action of bacteria, although in any of them this additional factor may be present.The most common cause of venous thrombosis, however, is inflammation of the wall of the vein phlebitis.
Hamorrhage|"Hamorrhage  from erosion of arterial or venous trunks may take place and endanger life.Treatment.The treatment of diffuse cellulitis depends to a large extent on the situation and extent of the affected area, and on the stage of the process.In the limbs , for example, where the application of a constricting band is practicable, Bier's method of inducing passive hyperamia yields excellent results.If pus is formed, one or more small incisions are made and a light moist dressing placed over the wounds to absorb the discharge, but no drain is inserted.The whole of the inflamed area should be covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 in 10 solution of ichthyol in glycerine.Hamorrhage is easily controlled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be dispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere with the vitality of the flaps.When the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be justifiable, if the patient urgently desires it, to amputate lower than the knee; but there is considerable risk of gangrene recurring in the stump and necessitating a second operation.That amputation for senile gangrene performed between the ankle and the knee seldom succeeds, is explained by the fact that the vascular obstruction is usually in the upper part of the posterior tibial artery, and the operation is therefore performed through tissues with an inadequate blood supply.It is not uncommon, indeed, on amputating above the knee, to find even the popliteal artery plugged by a clot.This should be removed at the amputation by squeezing the vessel from above downward by a ""milking"" movement, or by ""catheterising the artery"" with the aid of a cannula with a terminal aperture.It is to be borne in mind that the object of amputation in these cases is merely to remove the gangrenous part, and so relieve the patient of the discomfort and the risks from infection which its presence involves.Hamorrhage is rarely a prominent feature, but discharge of blood may constitute a symptom of considerable diagnostic importance in cancer of internal organs such as the rectum, the bladder, or the uterus.The Contagiousness of Cancer.A limited number of cases are on record in which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from the lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the tongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being all examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or frequently in contact.The transference of cancer from one human being to another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding his finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction of a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known to occur.It is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence takes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent nodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of stitches in its neighbourhood.In the lower animals the grafting of cancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a cancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but only in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was taken.Hamorrhage is seldom a prominent feature, as the crushing or tearing of the vessel wall leads to the obliteration of the lumen.The  special risks  of these wounds are: (1) Sloughing of the bruised tissues, especially when attempts to sterilise the wound have not been successful.(2) Reactionary hamorrhage after the initial shock has passed off.(3) Secondary hamorrhage as a result of infective processes ensuing in the wound.(4) Loss of muscle or tendon, interfering with motion.(5) Cicatricial contraction.Hamorrhage is arrested in the limbs by an improvised tourniquet; in the head by a pad and bandage; in the thorax or abdomen by packing if necessary, but this should be avoided if possible, as it favours septic infection.If a limb is all but detached it should be completely severed.A full dose of morphin is given hypodermically.The ampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents are poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is applied.In extensive wounds, the ""shell-dressing"" carried by the stretcher bearers is preferred.All bandages are applied loosely to allow for subsequent swelling.Hamorrhage is known as arterial, venous, or capillary, according to the nature of the vessel from which it takes place.In  arterial  hamorrhage the blood is bright red in colour, and escapes from the cardiac end of the divided vessel in pulsating jets synchronously with the systole of the heart.In vascular parts for example the face both ends of a divided artery bleed freely.The blood flowing from an artery may be dark in colour if the respiration is impeded.When the heart's action is weak and the blood tension low the flow may appear to be continuous and not in jets.The blood from a divided artery at the bottom of a deep wound, escapes on the surface in a steady flow.THE NATURAL ARREST OF HAMORRHAGE AND THE REPAIR OF BLOOD VESSELS  Primary Hamorrhage.The term primary hamorrhage is applied to the bleeding which follows immediately on the wounding of a blood vessel.The natural process by which such hamorrhage is arrested varies with the character of the wound in the vessel and may be modified by accidental circumstances.(a)  Repair of completely divided Artery.When an artery is  completely  divided, the circular fibres of the muscular coat contract, so that the lumen of the cut ends is diminished, and at the same time each segment retracts within its sheath in virtue of the recoil of the elastic elements in its walls, the tunica intima curls up in the interior of the vessel, and the tunica externa collapses over the cut ends.The blood that escapes from the injured vessel fills the interstices of the tissues, and, coagulating, forms a clot which temporarily arrests the bleeding.Conditions which influence the Natural Arrest of Hamorrhage.The natural arrest of bleeding is favoured by tearing or crushing of the vessel walls, owing to the contraction and retraction of the coats and the tendency of blood to coagulate when in contact with damaged tissue.Hence the primary hamorrhage following lacerated wounds is seldom copious.The occurrence of syncope or of profound shock also helps to stop bleeding by reducing the force of the heart's action.On the other hand, there are conditions which retard the natural arrest.When, for example, a vessel is only partly divided, the contraction and retraction of the muscular coat, instead of diminishing the calibre of the artery, causes the wound in the vessel to gape; by completing the division of the vessel under these circumstances the bleeding can often be arrested.Prevention of Hamorrhage.Whenever possible, hamorrhage should be controlled by  digital compression  of the main artery supplying the limb rather than by a tourniquet.If efficiently applied compression reduces the immediate loss of blood to a minimum, and the bleeding from small vessels that follows the removal of the tourniquet is avoided.Further, the pressure of a tourniquet has been shown to be a material factor in producing shock.In selecting a point at which to apply digital compression, it is essential that the vessel should be lying over a bone which will furnish the necessary resistance.The common carotid, for example, is pressed backward and medially against the transverse process (carotid tubercle) of the sixth cervical vertebra; the temporal against the temporal process (zygoma) in front of the ear; and the facial against the mandible at the anterior edge of the masseter.Arrest of Hamorrhage.Ligature.This is the best means of securing the larger vessels.The divided vessel having been caught with forceps as near to its cut end as possible, a ligature of catgut or silk is tied round it.When there is difficulty in applying a ligature securely, for example in a dense tissue like the scalp or periosteum, or in a friable tissue like the thyreoid gland or the mesentery, a stitch should be passed so as to surround the bleeding vessel a short distance from its end, in this way ensuring a better hold and preventing the ligature from slipping.If the hamorrhage is from a partly divided vessel, this should be completely cut across to enable its walls to contract and retract, and to facilitate the application of forceps and ligatures.Hamorrhage from bone, for example the skull, may be arrested by means of Horsley's aseptic plastic wax.To stop persistent oozing from soft tissues, Horsley successfully applied a portion of living vascular tissue, such as a fragment of muscle, which readily adheres to the oozing surface and yields elements that cause coagulation of the blood by thrombo-kinetic processes.When examined after two or three days the muscle has been found to be closely adherent and undergoing organisation.Arrest of Accidental Hamorrhage.The most efficient means of temporarily controlling hamorrhage is by pressure applied with the finger, or with a pad of gauze, directly over the bleeding point.While this is maintained an assistant makes digital pressure, or applies a tourniquet, over the main vessel of the limb on the proximal side of the bleeding point.Arrest of Accidental Hamorrhage.The most efficient means of temporarily controlling hamorrhage is by pressure applied with the finger, or with a pad of gauze, directly over the bleeding point.While this is maintained an assistant makes digital pressure, or applies a tourniquet, over the main vessel of the limb on the proximal side of the bleeding point.A useful  emergency tourniquet  may be improvised by folding a large handkerchief  en cravatte , with a cork or piece of wood in the fold to act as a pad.The handkerchief is applied round the limb, with the pad over the main artery, and the ends knotted on the lateral aspect of the limb.With a strong piece of wood the handkerchief is wound up like a Spanish windlass, until sufficient pressure is exerted to arrest the bleeding.Reactionary Hamorrhage.Reactionary or intermediary hamorrhage is really a recurrence of primary bleeding.As the name indicates, it occurs during the period of reaction that is, within the first twelve hours after an operation or injury.It may be due to the increase in the blood-pressure that accompanies reaction displacing clots which have formed in the vessels, or causing vessels to bleed which did not bleed during the operation; to the slipping of a ligature; or to the giving way of a grossly damaged portion of the vessel wall.In the scrotum, the relaxation of the dartos during the first few hours after operation occasionally leads to reactionary hamorrhage.As a rule, reactionary hamorrhage takes place from small vessels as a result of the displacement of occluding clots, and in many cases the hamorrhage stops when the bandages and soaked dressings are removed.Secondary Hamorrhage.The term secondary hamorrhage refers to bleeding that is delayed in its onset and is due to pyogenic infection of the tissues around an artery.The septic process causes softening and erosion of the wall of the artery so that it gives way under the pressure of the contained blood.The leakage may occur in drops, or as a rush of blood, according to the extent of the erosion, the size of the artery concerned, and the relations of the erosion to the surrounding tissues.When met with as a complication of a wound there is an interval usually a week to ten days between the receipt of the wound and the first hamorrhage, this time being required for the extension of the septic process to the wall of the artery and the consequent erosion of its coats.When secondary hamorrhage occurs apart from a wound, there is a similar septic process attacking the wall of the artery from the outside; for example in sloughing sore-throat, the separation of a slough may implicate the wall of an artery and be followed by serious and it may be fatal hamorrhage.Local Measures to arrest the Hamorrhage.The occurrence of even slight hamorrhages from a septic wound in the vicinity of a large blood vessel is to be taken seriously; it is usually necessary to  open up the wound , clear out the clots and infected tissues with a sharp spoon, disinfect the walls of the cavity with eusol or hydrogen peroxide, and  pack  it carefully but not too tightly with gauze impregnated with some antiseptic, such as ""bipp,"" so that, if the bleeding does not recur, it may be left undisturbed for several days.The packing should if possible be brought into actual contact with the leaking point in the vessel, and so arranged as to make pressure on the artery above the erosion.The dressings and bandage are then applied, with the limb in the attitude that will diminish the force of the stream through the main artery, for example, flexion at the elbow in hamorrhage from the deep palmar arch.Other measures for combating the local sepsis, such as the irrigation method of Carrel, may be considered.If the wound involves one of the extremities, it may be useful; and it imparts confidence to the nurse, and, it may be, to the patient, if a Petit's tourniquet is loosely applied above the wound, which the nurse is instructed to tighten up in the event of bleeding taking place.Hamorrhage of Toxic Origin.Mention must also be made of hamorrhages which depend upon infective or toxic conditions and in which no gross lesion of the vessels can be discovered.The bleeding occurs as an oozing, which may be comparatively slight and unimportant, or by its persistence may become serious.It takes place into the superficial layers of the skin, from mucous membranes, and into the substance of such organs as the pancreas.Hamorrhage from the stomach and intestine, attended with a brown or black discoloration of the vomit and of the stools, is one of the best known examples: it is not uncommonly met with in infective conditions originating in the appendix, intestine, gall-bladder, and other abdominal organs.Hamorrhage from the mucous membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations apparently also due to toxic causes and not to the operation gives rise to the so-called  post-operative hamatemesis .Hamorrhage from the stomach and intestine, attended with a brown or black discoloration of the vomit and of the stools, is one of the best known examples: it is not uncommonly met with in infective conditions originating in the appendix, intestine, gall-bladder, and other abdominal organs.Hamorrhage from the mucous membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations apparently also due to toxic causes and not to the operation gives rise to the so-called  post-operative hamatemesis .Constitutional Effects of Hamorrhage.The severity of the symptoms resulting from hamorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost.The sudden loss of a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous cavity for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen is attended with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin, especially of the face, feet, and hands.The skin is moist with a cold, clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead.Hamorrhage from the mucous membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations apparently also due to toxic causes and not to the operation gives rise to the so-called  post-operative hamatemesis .Constitutional Effects of Hamorrhage.The severity of the symptoms resulting from hamorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost.The sudden loss of a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous cavity for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen is attended with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin, especially of the face, feet, and hands.The skin is moist with a cold, clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead.The pulse becomes feeble, soft, and rapid, and the patient is dull and listless, and complains of extreme thirst.Constitutional Effects of Hamorrhage.The severity of the symptoms resulting from hamorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost.The sudden loss of a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous cavity for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen is attended with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin, especially of the face, feet, and hands.The skin is moist with a cold, clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead.The pulse becomes feeble, soft, and rapid, and the patient is dull and listless, and complains of extreme thirst.The temperature is usually sub-normal; and the respiration rapid, shallow, and sighing in character.Hamorrhage  may take place from a varicose vein as a result of a wound or of ulceration of its wall.Increased intra-venous pressure produced by severe muscular strain may determine rupture of a vein exposed in the floor of an ulcer.If the limb is dependent, the incompetency of the valves permits of rapid and copious bleeding, which may prove fatal, particularly if the patient is intoxicated when the rupture takes place and no means are taken to arrest the hamorrhage.The bleeding may be arrested at once by elevating the limb, or by applying pressure directly over the bleeding point.Phlebitis and thrombosis  are common sequela of varix, and may prove dangerous, either by spreading into the large venous trunks or by giving rise to emboli.The larger the varix the greater is the tendency for a thrombus to spread upwards and to involve the deep veins.Hamorrhages also occur into the skin, presenting the appearance of bruises, into the orbit and conjunctiva, and from the mucous membranes.The  treatment  consists in correcting the errors in diet.The infant should have a wet nurse or a plentiful supply of cow's milk in its natural state.Anti-scorbutics in the form of orange, lemon, or grape juice, and of potatoes bruised down in milk, may be given.Osteomalacia.The term osteomalacia includes a group of conditions, closely allied to rickets, in which the bones of adults become soft and yielding, so that they are unduly liable to bend or break."
The cutaneous navus|"The cutaneous navus , ""mother's mark,"" or ""port-wine stain,"" consists of an aggregation of dilated capillaries in the substance of the skin.On stretching the skin the vessels can be seen to form a fine network, or to run in leashes parallel to one another.A dilated arteriole or a vein winding about among the capillaries may sometimes be detected.These navi occur on any part of the body, but they are most frequently met with on the face.They may be multiple, and vary greatly in size, some being no bigger than a pin-head, while others cover large areas of the body.In colour they present every tint from purple to brilliant red; in the majority there is a considerable dash of blue, especially in cold weather."
Mixed Navus|Mixed Navus.As its name indicates, the mixed navus partakes of the characters of the other two varieties; that is, it is a subcutaneous navus with involvement of the skin.It is frequently met with on the face and head, but may occur on any part of the body.It also affects parts covered by mucous membrane, such as the cheek, tongue, and soft palate.The swelling is rounded or lobulated, and projects beyond the level of its surroundings.Sometimes the skin is invaded by the navoid tissue over the whole extent of the tumour, sometimes only over a limited area.

narrowings|The affected vessels slowly increase in size, and become tortuous, with narrowings and dilatations here and there.Grooves and gutters are frequently found in the bone underlying the dilated vessels.There is a constant loud bruit in the tumour, which greatly troubles the patient and may interfere with sleep.There is no tendency either to natural cure or to rupture, but severe and even fatal hamorrhage may follow a wound of the dilated vessels.The condition may be treated by excision or by electrolysis.In excision the hamorrhage is controlled by an elastic tourniquet applied horizontally round the head, or by ligation of the feeding trunks.
Extirpation|Extirpation of the Sac The Old Operation.The procedure which goes by this name consists in exposing the aneurysm, incising the sac, clearing out the clots, and ligating the artery above and below the sac.This method is suitable to sacculated aneurysm of the limbs, so long as they are circumscribed and free from complications.It has been successfully practised also in aneurysm of the subclavian, carotid, and external iliac arteries.It is not applicable to cases in which there is such a degree of atheroma as would interfere with the successful ligation of the artery.The continuity of the artery may be restored by grafting into the gap left after excision of the sac a segment of the great saphena vein.Extirpation of the sac is probably the best method of treatment, especially in those of traumatic origin.These operations are attended with considerable risk of hemiplegia from interference with the blood supply of the brain.The  external carotid  and the cervical portion of the  internal carotid  are seldom the primary seat of aneurysm, although they are liable to be implicated by the upward spread of an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the common trunk.In addition to the ordinary signs of aneurysm, the clinical manifestations are chiefly referable to pressure on the pharynx and larynx, and on the hypoglossal nerve.Aneurysm of the internal carotid is of special importance on account of the way in which it bulges into the pharynx in the region of the tonsil, in some cases closely simulating a tonsillar abscess.Cases are on record in which such an aneurysm has been mistaken for an abscess and incised, with disastrous results.Extirpation of the sac is the operation of choice, but, if this is impracticable, ligation of the third part of the subclavian may be had recourse to.Brachial aneurysm  usually occurs at the bend of the elbow, is of traumatic origin, and is best treated by excision of the sac.Aneurysmal varix , which was frequently met with in this situation in the days of the barber-surgeons, usually as a result of the artery having been accidentally wounded while performing venesection of the median basilic vein, may be treated, according to the amount of discomfort it causes, by a supporting bandage, or by ligation of the artery above and below the point of communication.Aneurysms of the vessels of the  forearm and hand  call for no special mention; they are almost invariably traumatic, and are treated by excision of the sac.Inguinal Aneurysm  ( Aneurysm of the Iliac and Femoral Arteries ).Aneurysms appearing in the region of Poupart's ligament may have their origin in the external or common iliac arteries or in the upper part of the femoral.Extirpation of the sac is difficult and dangerous, especially when the aneurysm has spread into the pelvis.Femoral Aneurysm.Aneurysm of the femoral artery beyond the origin of the profunda branch is usually traumatic in origin, and is more common in Scarpa's triangle than in Hunter's canal.Any of the methods already described is available for their treatment the choice lying between Matas' operation and ligation of the external iliac.Aneurysm of the  profunda femoris  is distinguished from that of the main trunk by the fact that the pulses beyond are, in the former, unaffected, and by the normal artery being felt pulsating over or alongside the sac.In  aneurysmal varix , a not infrequent result of a bullet wound or a stab, the communication with the vein may involve the main trunk of the femoral artery.
the Sac The Old Operation|Extirpation of the Sac The Old Operation.The procedure which goes by this name consists in exposing the aneurysm, incising the sac, clearing out the clots, and ligating the artery above and below the sac.This method is suitable to sacculated aneurysm of the limbs, so long as they are circumscribed and free from complications.It has been successfully practised also in aneurysm of the subclavian, carotid, and external iliac arteries.It is not applicable to cases in which there is such a degree of atheroma as would interfere with the successful ligation of the artery.The continuity of the artery may be restored by grafting into the gap left after excision of the sac a segment of the great saphena vein.
Distal Ligation|"Distal Ligation.The tying of the artery beyond the sac, or of its two branches where it bifurcates (Brasdor, 1760, and Wardrop, 1825), may arrest or only diminish the flow of blood through the sac.It is less successful than the proximal ligature, and is therefore restricted to aneurysms so situated as not to be amenable to other methods; for example, in aneurysm of the common carotid near its origin, the artery may be ligated near its bifurcation, or in aneurysm of the innominate artery, the carotid and subclavian arteries are tied at the seat of election.Compression.Digital compression of the feeding artery has been given up except as a preparation for operations on the sac with a view to favouring the development of a collateral circulation.Macewen's acupuncture or ""needling""  consists in passing one or more fine, highly tempered steel needles through the tissues overlying the aneurysm, and through its outer wall."
white gelatin|solution of white gelatin in normal salt solution being injected at a temperature of about 100° F.; the injection of pituitary extract.The application of a pad of gauze soaked in the blood of a normal person sometimes arrests the bleeding.To prevent bleeding in hamophilics, intra-venous or subcutaneous injections of fresh blood serum, taken from the human subject, the sheep, the dog, or the horse, have proved useful.If fresh serum is not available, anti-diphtheritic or anti-tetanic serum or trade preparations, such as hemoplastin, may be employed.We have removed the appendix and amputated through the thigh in hamophilic subjects without excessive loss of blood after a course of fresh sheep's serum given by the mouth over a period of several weeks.The chloride and lactate of calcium, and extract of thymus gland have been employed to increase the coagulability of the blood.solution of white gelatin in sterilised water, at a temperature of about 100° F., are injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen every two, three, or four days.In the course of a fortnight or three weeks improvement may begin.The clot which forms is liable to soften and be absorbed, but a repetition of the injection has in several cases established a permanent cure.Amputation of the limb  is indicated in cases complicated by suppuration, by secondary hamorrhage after excision or ligation, or by gangrene.Amputation at the shoulder was performed by Fergusson in a case of subclavian aneurysm, as a means of arresting the blood-flow through the sac.TRAUMATIC ANEURYSM The essential feature of a traumatic aneurysm is that it is produced by some form of injury which divides all the coats of the artery.
Innominate|Innominate aneurysm  may be of the fusiform or of the sacculated variety, and is frequently associated with pouching of the aorta.It usually grows upwards and laterally, projecting above the sternum and right clavicle, which may be eroded or displaced (Fig.75).Symptoms of pressure on the structures in the neck, similar to those produced by aortic aneurysm, occur.The pulses in the right upper extremity and in the right carotid and its branches are diminished and delayed.Pressure on the right brachial plexus causes shooting pain down the arm and muscular paresis on that side.
Orbital Aneurysm|Orbital Aneurysm.The term pulsating exophthalmos is employed to embrace a number of pathological conditions, including aneurysm, in which the chief symptoms are pulsation in the orbit and protrusion of the eyeball.There may be, in addition, congestion and œdema of the eyelids, and a distinct thrill and murmur, which can be controlled by compression of the common carotid in the neck.Varying degrees of ocular paralysis and of interference with vision may also be present.These symptoms are due, in the majority of cases, to an aneurysmal varix of the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus, which is often traumatic in origin, being produced either by fracture of the base of the skull or by a punctured wound of the orbit.In other cases they are due to aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery, to thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and, in rare instances, to cirsoid aneurysm.

Femoral Arteries|Inguinal Aneurysm  ( Aneurysm of the Iliac and Femoral Arteries ).Aneurysms appearing in the region of Poupart's ligament may have their origin in the external or common iliac arteries or in the upper part of the femoral.On account of the tension of the fascia lata, they tend to spread upwards towards the abdomen, and, to a less extent, downwards into the thigh.Sometimes a constriction occurs across the sac at the level of Poupart's ligament.The pressure exerted on the nerves and veins of the lower extremity causes pain, congestion, and œdema of the limb.Rupture may take place externally, or into the cellular tissue of the iliac fossa.
Surgical Anatomy and Physiology|Surgical Anatomy and Physiology.Lymph is essentially blood plasma, which has passed through the walls of capillaries.After bathing and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct.These lymph vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood vessels  perivascular lymph vessels .They have a structure similar to that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves.Along the course of the lymph trunks are the  lymph glands , which possess a definite capsule and are composed of a reticulated connective tissue, the spaces of which are packed with leucocytes.
glandula concatinata|The sterno-mastoid glands  glandula concatinata form a chain along the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, some of them lying beneath the muscle.They are commonly enlarged in secondary syphilis.The superior deep cervical (internal jugular) glands  from six to twenty in number form a continuous chain along the internal jugular vein, beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle.They drain the various groups of glands which lie nearer the surface, also the interior of the skull, the larynx, trachea, thyreoid, and lower part of the pharynx, and pour their lymph into the main trunks at the root of the neck.Belonging to this group is one large gland (the tonsillar gland) which lies behind the posterior belly of the digastric, and rests in the angle between the internal jugular and common facial veins.It is commonly enlarged in affections of the tonsil and posterior part of the tongue.
anticus major muscle|The retro-pharyngeal glands  lie on each side of the median line upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle and in front of the pre-vertebral layer of the cervical fascia.They receive part of the lymph from the posterior wall of the pharynx, the interior of the nose and its accessory cavities, the auditory (Eustachian) tube, and the tympanum.When they are infected with pyogenic organisms or with tubercle bacilli, they may lead to the formation of one form of retro-pharyngeal abscess.Upper Extremity.The epi-trochlear and cubital glands  vary in number, that most commonly present lying about an inch and a half above the medial epi-condyle, and other and smaller glands may lie along the medial (internal) bicipital groove or at the bend of the elbow.They drain the ulnar side of the hand and forearm, and pour their lymph into the axillary group.
chyle  chylorrhœa|The injury may, however, not be observed at the time of operation, but later through the dressings being soaked with chyle  chylorrhœa .If the wound involves the only existing main duct and all the chyle escapes, the patient suffers from intense thirst, emaciation, and weakness, and may die of inanition; but if, as is usually the case, only one of several collateral channels is implicated, the loss of chyle may be of little moment, as the discharge usually ceases.If the wound heals so that the chyle is prevented from escaping, a fluctuating swelling may form beneath the scar; in course of time it gradually disappears.An attempt should be made to close the wound in the duct by means of a fine suture; failing this, the duct must be occluded by a ligature as if it were a bleeding artery.The tissues are then stitched over it and the skin wound accurately closed, so as to obtain primary union, firm pressure being applied by dressings and an elastic webbing bandage.Even if the main duct is obliterated, a collateral circulation is usually established.

lymphangiectasis|Apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with as the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels ( lymphangiectasis ); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known example is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.GANGLION This term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or colloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.The commonest variety the  carpal ganglion  popularly known as a sprained sinew is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig.60).It is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this region, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.The skin and fascia are movable over the cyst.An interesting type of lymphangiectasis is that which results from the presence of the  filaria Bancrofti  in the vessels, and is observed chiefly in the groin, spermatic cord, and scrotum of persons who have lived in the tropics.Filarial disease in the lymphatics of the groin  appears as a soft, doughy swelling, varying in size from a walnut to a cocoa-nut; it may partly disappear on pressure and when the patient lies down.The patient gives a history of feverish attacks of the nature of lymphangitis during which the swelling becomes painful and tender.These attacks may show a remarkable periodicity, and each may be followed by an increase in the size of the swelling, which may extend along the inguinal canal into the abdomen, or down the spermatic cord into the scrotum.On dissection, the swelling is found to be made up of dilated, tortuous, and thickened lymph vessels in which the parent worm is sometimes found, and of greatly enlarged lymph glands which have undergone fibrosis, with giant-cell formation and eosinophile aggregations.The fluid in the dilated vessels is either clear or turbid, in the latter case resembling chyle.
Lymphangioma|"CHAPTER XV THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS

Anatomy and Physiology INJURIES OF LYMPH VESSELS  Wounds of     thoracic duct  DISEASES OF LYMPH VESSELS Lymphangitis:      Varieties  Lymphangiectasis Filarial     disease Lymphangioma DISEASES OF LYMPH     GLANDS Lymphadenitis:  Septic ;  Tuberculous ;      Syphilitic  Lymphadenoma Leucocythamia TUMOURS.Surgical Anatomy and Physiology.Lymph is essentially blood plasma, which has passed through the walls of capillaries.After bathing and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct.These lymph vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood vessels  perivascular lymph vessels .They have a structure similar to that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves.Lymphangioma.A lymphangioma is a swelling composed of a series of cavities and channels filled with lymph and freely communicating with one another.The cavities result either from the new formation of lymph spaces or vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist; their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue lined by endothelium and strengthened by non-striped muscle.They are rarely provided with a definite capsule, and frequently send prolongations of their substance between and into muscles and other structures in their vicinity.They are of congenital origin and usually make their appearance at or shortly after birth.When the tumour is made up of a meshwork of caverns and channels, it is called a  cavernous lymphangioma ; when it is composed of one or more cysts, it is called a  cystic lymphangioma .Lymphangiomas are met with in the abdomen in the form of  omental cysts .DISEASES OF LYMPH GLANDS  Lymphadenitis.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa."
lymphangio|The  periosteal lipoma  is usually congenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a projecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles an angioma or a lymphangioma.The  subserous lipoma  arises from the extra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it tends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give rise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal fat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial openings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a  fatty hernia .A  subsynovial lipoma  grows from the fat surrounding the synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving rise to the symptoms of loose body.Lipomas are also met with growing from the adipose connective tissue  between or in the substance of muscles , and, when situated beneath the deep fascia, such as the fascia lata of the thigh, the characteristic signs are obscured and a differential diagnosis is difficult.It may be differentiated from a cold abscess by puncture with an exploring needle.Zanthoma  is a rare but interesting form of tumour, composed of a fibrous and fatty tissue, containing a granular orange-yellow pigment, resembling that of the corpus luteum.Angioma ,  lymphangioma , and  neuroma  are described with the disease of the individual tissues.MALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS SARCOMA The term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which exhibits malignant characters.The essential structural feature is the predominance of the cellular elements over the intercellular substance or stroma, in which respect a sarcoma resembles the connective tissue of the embryo.The typical sarcoma consists chiefly of immature or embryonic connective tissue.It most frequently originates from fascia, intermuscular connective tissue, periosteum, bone-marrow, and skin, and forms a rounded or nodulated tumour which appears to be encapsulated, but the capsule merely consists of the condensed surrounding tissues, and usually contains sarcomatous elements.The consistence of the tumour depends on the nature and amount of the stroma, and on the presence of degenerative changes.The term  lymphangio-sarcoma  is applied when the cells of the tumour are derived from the endothelium of lymph spaces and vessels.The  angio-sarcomas  are those in which blood vessels form a prominent element in the structure of the tumour.They are sometimes derived from innocent angiomas, and they may be so vascular as to pulsate and on auscultation yield a blowing murmur like an aneurysm.The  glio-sarcoma ,  myxo-sarcoma ,  chondro-sarcoma , and  myo-sarcoma  are mixed forms which usually develop in pre-existing innocent tumours.The  osteo-sarcoma  is characterised by the formation in the tumour of bone, the medullary spaces being occupied by sarcomatous cells in place of marrow.The  osteoid sarcoma  is characterised by the formation of a tissue resembling bone but deficient in lime salts, and the  petrifying sarcoma  by the formation of calcified areas in the stroma.Apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with as the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels ( lymphangiectasis ); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known example is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.GANGLION This term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or colloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.The commonest variety the  carpal ganglion  popularly known as a sprained sinew is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig.60).It is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this region, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.The skin and fascia are movable over the cyst.Handley has devised a method of treatment  lymphangioplasty  the object of which is to drain the lymph by embedding a number of silk threads in the subcutaneous cellular tissue.Wounds of the Thoracic Duct.The thoracic duct usually opens at the angle formed by the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins, but it may open into either of these vessels by one or by several channels, or the duct may be double throughout its course.There is a smaller duct on the right side the right lymphatic duct.The duct or ducts may be displaced by a tumour or a mass of enlarged glands, and may be accidentally wounded in dissections at the root of the neck; jets of milky fluid chyle may at once escape from it.The jets are rhythmical and coincide with expiration.A lymphangioma is a swelling composed of a series of cavities and channels filled with lymph and freely communicating with one another.The cavities result either from the new formation of lymph spaces or vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist; their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue lined by endothelium and strengthened by non-striped muscle.They are rarely provided with a definite capsule, and frequently send prolongations of their substance between and into muscles and other structures in their vicinity.They are of congenital origin and usually make their appearance at or shortly after birth.When the tumour is made up of a meshwork of caverns and channels, it is called a  cavernous lymphangioma ; when it is composed of one or more cysts, it is called a  cystic lymphangioma .It is probable that the cysts are derived from the caverns by breaking down and absorption of the intervening septa, as transition forms between the cavernous and cystic varieties are sometimes met with.When the tumour is made up of a meshwork of caverns and channels, it is called a  cavernous lymphangioma ; when it is composed of one or more cysts, it is called a  cystic lymphangioma .It is probable that the cysts are derived from the caverns by breaking down and absorption of the intervening septa, as transition forms between the cavernous and cystic varieties are sometimes met with.The  cavernous lymphangioma  appears as an ill-defined, soft swelling, presenting many of the characters of a subcutaneous hamangioma, but it is not capable of being emptied by pressure, it does not become tense when the blood pressure is raised, as in crying, and if the tumour is punctured, it yields lymph instead of blood.It also resembles a lipoma, especially the congenital variety which grows from the periosteum, and the differential diagnosis between these is rarely completed until the swelling is punctured or explored by operation.If treatment is called for, it is carried out on the same lines as for hamangioma, by means of electrolysis, igni-puncture, or excision.Complete excision is rarely possible because of the want of definition and encapsulation, but it is not necessary for cure, as the parts that remain undergo cicatrisation.The  cavernous lymphangioma  appears as an ill-defined, soft swelling, presenting many of the characters of a subcutaneous hamangioma, but it is not capable of being emptied by pressure, it does not become tense when the blood pressure is raised, as in crying, and if the tumour is punctured, it yields lymph instead of blood.It also resembles a lipoma, especially the congenital variety which grows from the periosteum, and the differential diagnosis between these is rarely completed until the swelling is punctured or explored by operation.If treatment is called for, it is carried out on the same lines as for hamangioma, by means of electrolysis, igni-puncture, or excision.Complete excision is rarely possible because of the want of definition and encapsulation, but it is not necessary for cure, as the parts that remain undergo cicatrisation.The  cystic lymphangioma ,  lymphatic cyst , or  congenital cystic hygroma  is most often met with in the neck  hydrocele of the neck ; it is situated beneath the deep fascia, and projects either in front of or behind the sterno-mastoid muscle.It may attain a large size, the overlying skin and cyst wall may be so thin as to be translucent, and it has been known to cause serious impairment of respiration through pressing on the trachea.The  cystic lymphangioma ,  lymphatic cyst , or  congenital cystic hygroma  is most often met with in the neck  hydrocele of the neck ; it is situated beneath the deep fascia, and projects either in front of or behind the sterno-mastoid muscle.It may attain a large size, the overlying skin and cyst wall may be so thin as to be translucent, and it has been known to cause serious impairment of respiration through pressing on the trachea.In the axilla also the cystic tumour may attain a considerable size (Fig.76); less frequent situations are the groin, and the floor of the mouth, where it constitutes one form of ranula.The nature of these swellings is to be recognised by their situation, by their having existed from infancy, and, if necessary, by drawing off some of the contents of the cyst through a fine needle.They are usually remarkably indolent, persisting often for a long term of years without change, and, like the hamangioma, they sometimes undergo spontaneous cicatrisation and cure.Samson Handley has sought to replace the blocked lymph vessels by burying in the subcutaneous tissue of the swollen part a number of stout silk threads  lymphangioplasty .By their capillary action they drain the lymph to a healthy region above, and thus enable it to enter the circulation.It has been more successful in the face and upper limb than in the lower extremity.If the tissues are infected with pus organisms, a course of vaccines should precede the operation.A similar type of elephantiasis may occur after extirpation of the lymph glands in the axilla or groin; in the leg in long-standing standing varix and phlebitis with chronic ulcer; in the arm as a result of extensive cancerous disease of the lymphatics in the axilla secondarily to cancer of the breast; and in extensive tuberculous disease of the lymphatics.The last-named is chiefly observed in the lower limb in young adult women, and from its following upon lupus of the toes or foot it has been called  lupus elephantiasis .
Lymphangiomas|Lymphangiomas are met with in the abdomen in the form of  omental cysts .DISEASES OF LYMPH GLANDS  Lymphadenitis.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa.

Tuberculous Disease of Glands|Tuberculous Disease of Glands.This is a disease of great frequency and importance.The tubercle bacilli usually gain access to the gland through the afferent lymph vessels, which convey them from some lesion of the surface within the area drained by them.Tuberculous infection may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic septic irritation.While any of the glands in the body may be affected, the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.The appearance of the glands on section  varies with the stage of the disease.
Syphilitic Disease of Glands|Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Enlargement of lymph glands is a prominent feature of acquired syphilis, especially in the form of the indolent or bullet-bubo which accompanies the primary lesion, and the general enlargement of glands that occurs in secondary syphilis.Gummatous disease in glands is extremely rare; the affected gland rapidly enlarges to the size of a walnut, and may then persist for a long period without further change; if it breaks down, the overlying skin is destroyed and the caseated tissue of the gumma exposed.Lymphadenoma.Hodgkin's Disease  (Pseudo-leukamia of German authors).This is a rare disease, the origin of which is as yet unknown, but analogy would suggest that it is due to infection with a slowly growing micro-organism.
leucocythamia|The enlargement associated with leucocythamia is differentiated by the characteristic changes in the blood.Treatment.In the acute form of lymphadenoma, treatment is of little avail.Arsenic may be given in full doses either by the mouth or by subcutaneous injection; the intravenous administration of neo-salvarsan may be tried.Exposure to the X-rays and to radium has been more successful than any other form of treatment.Excision of glands, although sometimes beneficial, seldom arrests the progress of the disease.

Repair and its modificati|"CHAPTER XVI THE NERVES

Anatomy INJURIES OF NERVES: Changes in nerves after division;     Repair and its modifications; Clinical features;  Primary and     secondary suture  SUBCUTANEOUS INJURIES OF     NERVES DISEASES:  Neuritis ;  Tumours  Surgery of     the individual nerves:  Brachial neuralgia ;  Sciatica ;      Trigeminal neuralgia .Anatomy.A nerve-trunk is made up of a variable number of bundles of nerve fibres surrounded and supported by a framework of connective tissue.The nerve fibres are chiefly of the medullated type, and they run without interruption from a nerve cell or  neuron  in the brain or spinal medulla to their peripheral terminations in muscle, skin, and secretory glands.Each nerve fibre consists of a number of nerve fibrils collected into a central bundle the axis cylinder which is surrounded by an envelope, the neurolemma or sheath of Schwann.Between the neurolemma and the axis cylinder is the medullated sheath, composed of a fatty substance known as myelin."
Complete Division|Complete Division of a Mixed Nerve.Complete division is a common result of accidental wounds, especially above the wrist, where the ulnar, median, and radial nerves are frequently cut across, and in gun-shot injuries.Changes in Structure and Function.The mere interruption of the continuity of a nerve results in degeneration of its fibres, the myelin being broken up into droplets and absorbed, while the axis cylinders swell up, disintegrate, and finally disappear.Both the conducting and the insulating elements are thus lost.The degeneration in the central end of the divided nerve is usually limited to the immediate proximity of the lesion, and does not even involve all the nerve fibres.
Process of Repair|Modifications of the Process of Repair.The process of repair by primary union, above described, is to be looked upon as the type of all reparative processes, such modifications as are met with depending merely upon incidental differences in the conditions present, such as loss of tissue, infection by micro-organisms, etc.Repair after Loss or Destruction of Tissue.When the edges of a wound cannot be approximated either because tissue has been lost, for example in excising a tumour or because a drainage tube or gauze packing has been necessary, a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to fill the gap, but the process is essentially the same as in the ideal method of repair.The raw surface is first covered by a layer of coagulated blood and fibrin.An extensive new formation of capillary loops and fibroblasts takes place towards the free surface, and goes on until the gap is filled by a fine velvet-like mass of granulation tissue.Process of Repair when the Ends are in Contact.If the wound is aseptic , and the ends of the divided nerve are sutured or remain in contact, they become united, and the conducting paths are re-established by a regeneration of nerve fibres.There is a difference of opinion as to the method of regeneration.The Wallerian doctrine is that the axis cylinders in the central end grow downwards, and enter the nerve sheaths of the distal portion, and continue growing until they reach the peripheral terminations in muscle and skin, and in course of time acquire a myelin sheath; the cells of the neurolemma multiply and form long chains in both ends of the nerve, and are believed to provide for the nourishment and support of the actively lengthening axis cylinders.Another view is that the formation of new axis cylinders is not confined to the central end, but that it goes on also in the peripheral segment, in which, however, the new axis cylinders do not attain maturity until continuity with the central end has been re-established.If the wound becomes infected  and suppuration occurs, the young nerve fibres are destroyed and efficient regeneration is prevented; the formation of scar tissue also may constitute a permanent obstacle to new nerve fibres bridging the gap.
Sensory Phenomena|Sensory Phenomena.Superficial touch is tested by means of a wisp of cotton wool stroked gently across the skin; the capacity of discriminating two points as separate, by a pair of blunt-pointed compasses; the sensation of pressure, by means of a pencil or other blunt object; of pain, by pricking or scratching with a needle; and of sensibility to heat and cold, by test-tubes containing water at different temperatures.While these tests are being carried out, the patient's eyes are screened off.After division of a nerve containing sensory fibres, there is an area of absolute cutaneous insensibility to touch (anasthesia), to pain (analgesia), and to all degrees of temperature  loss of protopathic sensibility ; surrounded by an area in which there is loss of sensation to light touch, inability to recognise minor differences of temperature (72°–104° F.), and to appreciate as separate impressions the contact of the two points of a compass  loss of epicritic sensibility  (Head and Sherren) (Figs.91, 92).Motor Phenomena.
Motor Phenomena|Motor Phenomena.There is immediate and complete loss of voluntary power in the muscles supplied by the divided nerve.The muscles rapidly waste, and within from three to five days, they cease to react to the faradic current.When tested with the galvanic current, it is found that a stronger current must be used to call forth contraction than in a healthy muscle, and the contraction appears first at the closing of the circuit when the anode is used as the testing electrode.The loss of excitability to the interrupted current, and the specific alteration in the type of contraction with the constant current, is known as the  reaction of degeneration .After a few weeks all electric excitability is lost.
Arthropathies|Arthropathies are occasionally met with, the joints becoming the seat of a painless effusion or hydrops, which is followed by fibrous thickening of the capsular and other ligaments, and terminates in stiffness and fibrous ankylosis.In this way the fingers are seriously crippled and deformed.Treatment of Divided Nerves.The treatment consists in approximating the divided ends of the nerve and placing them under the most favourable conditions for repair, and this should be done at the earliest possible opportunity.( Op.Surg.
Incomplete Division of a Mixed Nerve|Incomplete Division of a Mixed Nerve.The effects of partial division of a mixed nerve vary according to the destination of the nerve bundles that have been interrupted.Within their area of distribution the paralysis is as complete as if the whole trunk had been cut across.The uninjured nerve-bundles continue to transmit impulses with the result that there is a  dissociated paralysis  within the distribution of the affected nerve, some muscles continuing to act and to respond normally to electric stimulation, while others behave as if the whole nerve-trunk had been severed.In addition to vasomotor and trophic changes, there is often severe pain of a burning kind ( causalgia  or  thermalgia ) which comes on about a fortnight after the injury and causes intense and continuous suffering which may last for months.Paroxysms of pain may be excited by the slightest touch or by heat, and the patient usually learns for himself that the constant application of cold wet cloths allays the pain.
hyperasthesia|One of the most constant symptoms is the early occurrence of severe neuralgic pain, and this is usually associated with marked hyperasthesia.Regeneration.Process of Repair when the Ends are in Contact.If the wound is aseptic , and the ends of the divided nerve are sutured or remain in contact, they become united, and the conducting paths are re-established by a regeneration of nerve fibres.There is a difference of opinion as to the method of regeneration.The Wallerian doctrine is that the axis cylinders in the central end grow downwards, and enter the nerve sheaths of the distal portion, and continue growing until they reach the peripheral terminations in muscle and skin, and in course of time acquire a myelin sheath; the cells of the neurolemma multiply and form long chains in both ends of the nerve, and are believed to provide for the nourishment and support of the actively lengthening axis cylinders.Some weeks or months after the injury, the patient complains of increasing hyperasthesia and of neuralgic pains in the course of the nerve.The nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and, if superficial, may be felt to be swollen.The associated muscles are wasted and weak, and are subject to twitchings.There are also trophic disturbances.It is rare to have complete sensory and motor paralysis.The disease is commonest in the nerves of the upper extremity, and the hand may become crippled and useless.
Multiple Peripheral Neuritis|Multiple Peripheral Neuritis.Although this disease mainly comes under the cognizance of the physician, it may be attended with phenomena which call for surgical interference.In this country it is commonly due to alcoholism, but it may result from diabetes or from chronic poisoning with lead or arsenic, or from bacterial infections and intoxications such as occur in diphtheria, gonorrhœa, syphilis, leprosy, typhoid, influenza, beri-beri, and many other diseases.It is, as a rule, widely distributed throughout the peripheral nerves, but the distribution frequently varies with the cause the alcoholic form, for example, mainly affecting the legs, the diphtheritic form the soft palate and pharynx, and that associated with lead poisoning the forearms.The essential lesion is a degeneration of the conducting fibres of the affected nerves, and the prominent symptoms are the result of this.In alcoholic neuritis there is great tenderness of the muscles.
the ulnar nerve|This injury, which resembles the dislocation of tendons from their grooves, is seldom met with except in the ulnar nerve at the elbow, and is described with injuries of that nerve.DISEASES OF NERVES  Traumatic Neuritis.This consists in an overgrowth of the connective-tissue framework of a nerve, which causes irritation and pressure upon the nerve fibres, sometimes resulting in their degeneration.It may originate in connection with a wound in the vicinity of a nerve, as, for example, when the brachial nerves are involved in scar tissue subsequent to an operation for clearing out the axilla for cancer; or in contusion and compression of a nerve for example, by the pressure of the head of the humerus in a dislocation of the shoulder.Some weeks or months after the injury, the patient complains of increasing hyperasthesia and of neuralgic pains in the course of the nerve.The nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and, if superficial, may be felt to be swollen.Infra-clavicular injuries , as already stated, are most often produced by a sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus; the medial cord is that most frequently injured, and the muscles paralysed are those supplied by the ulnar nerve, with, in addition, those intrinsic muscles of the hand supplied by the median.Sensibility is affected over the medial surface of the forearm and ulnar area of the hand.Injury of the lateral and posterior cords is very rare.Treatment  is carried out on the lines already laid down for nerve injuries in general.It is impossible to diagnose between complete and incomplete rupture of the nerve cords, until sufficient time has elapsed to allow of the establishment of the reaction of degeneration.If this is present at the end of fourteen days, operation should not be delayed.Dislocation of the ulnar nerve  at the elbow results from sudden and violent flexion of the joint, the muscular effort causing stretching or laceration of the fascia that holds the nerve in its groove; it is predisposed to if the groove is shallow as a result of imperfect development of the medial condyle of the humerus, and by cubitus valgus.The nerve slips forward, and may be felt lying on the medial aspect of the condyle.It may retain this position, or it may slip backwards and forwards with the movements of the arm.The symptoms at the time of the displacement are some disability at the elbow, and pain and tingling along the nerve, which are exaggerated by movement and by pressure.The symptoms may subside altogether, or a neuritis may develop, with severe pain shooting up the nerve.The dislocated nerve is easily replaced, but is difficult to retain in position.
ossis metacarpi|The palmaris longus is anastomosed with the abductor pollicis longus (extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis), thus securing a fair amount of abduction of the thumb.The flexor carpi ulnaris may also be anastomosed with the common extensor of the fingers.The extensors of the wrist may be shortened, so as to place the hand in the position of dorsal flexion, and thus improve the attitude and grasp of the hand.The superficial branch of the radial  (radial nerve)  and the deep branch  (posterior interosseous), apart from suffering in lesions of the radial, are liable to be contused or torn is dislocation of the head of the radius, and in fracture of the neck of the bone.The deep branch may be divided as it passes through the supinator in operations on old fractures and dislocations in the region of the elbow.Division of the superficial branch in the upper two-thirds of the forearm produces no loss of sensibility; division in the lower third after the nerve has become associated with branches from the musculo-cutaneous is followed by a loss of sensibility on the radial side of the hand and thumb.ossis metacarpi pollicis), while opposition may be simulated by contraction of the long flexor and the short abductor of the thumb; the paralysis of the two medial lumbricals produces no symptoms that can be recognised.It is important to remember that when the median nerve is divided at the wrist, deep touch can be appreciated over the whole of the area supplied by the nerve; the injury, therefore, is liable to be over looked.If, however, the tendons are divided as well as the nerve, there is insensibility to deep touch.The areas of epicritic and of protopathic insensibility are illustrated in Fig.91.The division of the nerve at the elbow, or even at the axilla, does not increase the extent of the loss of epicritic or protopathic sensibility, but usually affects deep sensibility.
The Ulnar Nerve|The Ulnar Nerve.The most common injury of this nerve is its division in transverse accidental wounds just above the wrist.In the arm it may be contused, along with the radial, in crutch paralysis; in the region of the elbow it may be injured in fractures or dislocations, or it may be accidentally divided in the operation for excising the elbow-joint.When it is injured  at or above the elbow , there is paralysis of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus, all the interossei, the two medial lumbricals, and the adductors of the thumb.The hand assumes a characteristic attitude: the index and middle fingers are extended at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints owing to paralysis of the interosseous muscles attached to them; the little and ring fingers are hyper-extended at these joints in consequence of the paralysis of the lumbricals; all the fingers are flexed at the inter-phalangeal joints, the flexion being most marked in the little and ring fingers claw-hand or  main en griffe .On flexing the wrist, the hand is tilted to the radial side, but the paralysis of the flexor carpi ulnaris is often compensated for by the action of the palmaris longus.
cubitus valgus|Dislocation of the ulnar nerve  at the elbow results from sudden and violent flexion of the joint, the muscular effort causing stretching or laceration of the fascia that holds the nerve in its groove; it is predisposed to if the groove is shallow as a result of imperfect development of the medial condyle of the humerus, and by cubitus valgus.The nerve slips forward, and may be felt lying on the medial aspect of the condyle.It may retain this position, or it may slip backwards and forwards with the movements of the arm.The symptoms at the time of the displacement are some disability at the elbow, and pain and tingling along the nerve, which are exaggerated by movement and by pressure.The symptoms may subside altogether, or a neuritis may develop, with severe pain shooting up the nerve.The dislocated nerve is easily replaced, but is difficult to retain in position.
The Sciatic Nerve|"The Sciatic Nerve.When this nerve is compressed, as by sitting on a fence, there is tingling and powerlessness in the limb as a whole, known as ""sleeping"" of the limb, but these phenomena are evanescent.Injuries to the great sciatic nerve  are rare except in war.Partial division is more common than complete, and it is noteworthy that the fibres destined for the peroneal nerve are more often and more severely injured than those for the tibial (internal popliteal).After complete division, all the muscles of the leg are paralysed; if the section is in the upper part of the thigh, the hamstrings are also paralysed.The limb is at first quite powerless, but the patient usually recovers sufficiently to be able to walk with a little support, and although the hamstrings are paralysed the knee can be flexed by the sartorius and gracilis."
The Common Peroneal|"The Common Peroneal (external popliteal) nerve  is exposed to injury where it winds round the neck of the fibula, because it is superficial and lies against the unyielding bone.It may be compressed by a tourniquet, or it may be bruised or torn in fractures of the upper end of the bone.It has been divided in accidental wounds, by a scythe, for example, in incising for cellulitis, and in performing subcutaneous tenotomy of the biceps tendon.Cases have been observed of paralysis of the nerve as a result of prolonged acute flexion of the knee in certain occupations.When the nerve is divided, the most obvious result is ""drop-foot""; the patient is unable to dorsiflex the foot and cannot lift his toes off the ground, so that in walking he is obliged to jerk the foot forwards and laterally.The loss of sensibility depends upon whether the nerve is divided above or below the origin of the large cutaneous branch which comes off just before it passes round the neck of the fibula."
The Injection of Alcohol|The Injection of Alcohol into the Nerve.The alcohol acts by destroying the nerve fibres, and must be brought into direct contact with them; if the nerve has been properly struck the injection is followed by complete anasthesia in the distribution of the nerve.The relief may last for from six months to three years; if the pain returns, the injection may be repeated.The strength of the alcohol should be 85 per cent., and the amount injected about 2 c.c.; a general, or preferably a local, anasthetic (novocain) should be employed (Schlösser); the needle is 8 cm.long, and 0.7 mm.
novocain-suprarenin|solution of  novocain-suprarenin  through it before the alcohol is injected.The treatment by injection of alcohol is superior to the resection of branches of the nerve, for though relapses occur after the treatment with alcohol, renewed freedom from pain may be obtained by its repetition.The ophthalmic division should not, however, be treated in this manner, for the alcohol may escape into the orbit and endanger other nerves in this region.Harris recommends the injection of alcohol into the semilunar ganglion.Operative Treatment.This consists in the removal of the affected nerve or nerves, either by resection  neurectomy ; or by a combination of resection with twisting or tearing of the nerve from its central connections  avulsion .

Boils and Carbuncles|"Boils and Carbuncles.These result from infection with the staphylococcus aureus, which enters the orifices of the ducts of the skin under the influence of friction and pressure, as was demonstrated by the well-known experiment of Garrè, who produced a crop of pustules and boils on his own forearm by rubbing in a culture of the staphylococcus aureus.A  boil  results when the infection is located in a hair follicle or sebaceous gland.A hard, painful, conical swelling develops, to which, so long as the skin retains its normal appearance, the term ""blind boil"" is applied.Usually, however, the skin becomes red, and after a time breaks, giving exit to a drop or two of thick pus.After an interval of from six to ten days a soft white slough is discharged; this is known as the ""core,"" and consists of the necrosed hair follicle or sebaceous gland."
ceous gland|"The more highly organised elements of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands, are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and hairless.Epithelium.Epithelium is only reproduced from pre-existing epithelium, and, as a rule, from one of a similar type, although metaplastic transformation of cells of one kind of epithelium into another kind can take place.Thus a granulating surface may be covered entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins; or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw area.Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of loose epithelial cells from the edges.Even the fluid from a blister, in virtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface.Thus a granulating surface may be covered entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins; or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw area.Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of loose epithelial cells from the edges.Even the fluid from a blister, in virtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface.Hairs and nails may be completely regenerated if a sufficient amount of the hair follicles or of the nail matrix has escaped destruction.The epithelium of a mucous membrane is regenerated in the same way as that on a cutaneous surface.Epithelial cells have the power of living for some time after being separated from their normal surroundings, and of growing again when once more placed in favourable circumstances.A  boil  results when the infection is located in a hair follicle or sebaceous gland.A hard, painful, conical swelling develops, to which, so long as the skin retains its normal appearance, the term ""blind boil"" is applied.Usually, however, the skin becomes red, and after a time breaks, giving exit to a drop or two of thick pus.After an interval of from six to ten days a soft white slough is discharged; this is known as the ""core,"" and consists of the necrosed hair follicle or sebaceous gland.After the separation of the core the boil heals rapidly, leaving a small depressed scar.Boils are most frequently met with on the back of the neck and the buttocks, and on other parts where the skin is coarse and thick and is exposed to friction and pressure.After an interval of from six to ten days a soft white slough is discharged; this is known as the ""core,"" and consists of the necrosed hair follicle or sebaceous gland.After the separation of the core the boil heals rapidly, leaving a small depressed scar.Boils are most frequently met with on the back of the neck and the buttocks, and on other parts where the skin is coarse and thick and is exposed to friction and pressure.The occurrence of a number or a succession of boils is due to spread of the infection, the cocci from the original boil obtaining access to adjacent hair follicles.The spread of boils may be unwittingly promoted by the use of a domestic poultice or the wearing of infected underclothing.While boils are frequently met with in debilitated persons, and particularly in those suffering from diabetes or Bright's disease, they also occur in those who enjoy vigorous health.In young infants, abscesses are not infrequently met with scattered over the trunk and limbs, and are probably the result of infection of the sebaceous glands from dirty underclothing.The abscesses should be opened, and the further spread of infection prevented by cleansing of the skin and by the use of clean under-linen.Similar abscesses are met with on the scalp in association with eczema, impetigo, and pediculosis.Veldt Sore.This sore usually originates in an abrasion of the epidermis, such as a sun blister, the bite of an insect, or a scratch.A pustule forms and bursts, and a brownish-yellow scab forms over it.Atheromatous cysts or wens are formed in relation to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles.They are commonly met with in adults, on the scalp (Fig.99), face, neck, back, and external genitals.Sometimes they are multiple, and they may be met with in several members of the same family.They are smooth, rounded, or discoid cysts, varying in size from a split-pea to a Tangerine orange.In consistence they are firm and elastic, or fluctuating, and are incorporated with the overlying skin, but movable on the deeper structures.The  sebaceous adenoma , which originates from the sebaceous glands, forms a projecting tumour on the face or scalp, and when the skin is irritated it may ulcerate and fungate.The treatment consists in the removal of the tumour along with the overlying skin.The exuberant masses on the nose known as ""rhinophyma,"" ""lipoma nasi,"" or ""potato nose"" are of the nature of sebaceous adenoma, and are removed by shaving them off with a knife until the normal shape of the nose is restored Healing takes place with remarkable rapidity.Cancer.There are several types of primary cancer of the skin, the most important being squamous epithelioma, rodent cancer, and melanotic cancer.Epithelioma  occurs in a variety of forms."
inoculation tubercle|We have chiefly observed it in the femoral glands as a result of inoculation tubercle on the toes or sole of the foot.The affected glands nearly always break down and suppurate, and after destroying the overlying skin give rise to fungating ulcers.The treatment consists in excising the glands and the affected skin.The dissection may be attended with troublesome hamorrhage from the numerous veins that converge towards the femoral trunk.Tuberculous disease in the  mesenteric  and  bronchial glands  is described with the surgery of regions.Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Interest attaches chiefly to the primary forms of tuberculosis of the skin in which the bacilli penetrate from without inoculation tubercle and lupus.Inoculation Tubercle.The appearances vary with the conditions under which the inoculation takes place.As observed on the fingers of adults, the affection takes the form of an indolent painless swelling, the epidermis being red and glazed, or warty, and irregularly fissured.Sometimes the epidermis gives way, forming an ulcer with flabby granulations.The infection rarely spreads to the lymphatics, but we have seen inoculation tubercle of the index-finger followed by a large cold abscess on the median side of the upper arm and by a huge mass of breaking down glands in the axilla.The infection rarely spreads to the lymphatics, but we have seen inoculation tubercle of the index-finger followed by a large cold abscess on the median side of the upper arm and by a huge mass of breaking down glands in the axilla.In children who run about barefooted in towns, tubercle may be inoculated into wounds in the sole or about the toes, and although the local appearances may not be characteristic, the nature of the infection is revealed by its tendency to spread up the limb along the lymph vessels, giving rise to abscesses and fungating ulcers in relation to the femoral glands.Tuberculous Lupus.This is an extremely chronic affection of the skin.It rarely extends to the lymph glands, and of all tuberculous lesions is the least dangerous to life.The commonest form of lupus  lupus vulgaris  usually commences in childhood or youth, and is most often met with on the nose or cheek.

lymphangioplasty|Handley has devised a method of treatment  lymphangioplasty  the object of which is to drain the lymph by embedding a number of silk threads in the subcutaneous cellular tissue.Wounds of the Thoracic Duct.The thoracic duct usually opens at the angle formed by the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins, but it may open into either of these vessels by one or by several channels, or the duct may be double throughout its course.There is a smaller duct on the right side the right lymphatic duct.The duct or ducts may be displaced by a tumour or a mass of enlarged glands, and may be accidentally wounded in dissections at the root of the neck; jets of milky fluid chyle may at once escape from it.The jets are rhythmical and coincide with expiration.Samson Handley has sought to replace the blocked lymph vessels by burying in the subcutaneous tissue of the swollen part a number of stout silk threads  lymphangioplasty .By their capillary action they drain the lymph to a healthy region above, and thus enable it to enter the circulation.It has been more successful in the face and upper limb than in the lower extremity.If the tissues are infected with pus organisms, a course of vaccines should precede the operation.A similar type of elephantiasis may occur after extirpation of the lymph glands in the axilla or groin; in the leg in long-standing standing varix and phlebitis with chronic ulcer; in the arm as a result of extensive cancerous disease of the lymphatics in the axilla secondarily to cancer of the breast; and in extensive tuberculous disease of the lymphatics.The last-named is chiefly observed in the lower limb in young adult women, and from its following upon lupus of the toes or foot it has been called  lupus elephantiasis .
Hutchinson|"Erratic chancre is the term applied by Jonathan Hutchinson to the primary lesion of syphilis when it appears on parts of the body other than the genitals.It differs in some respects from the hard chancre as met with on the penis; it is usually larger, the induration is more diffused, and the enlarged glands are softer and more sensitive.The glands in nearest relation to the sore are those first affected, for example, the epitrochlear or axillary glands in chancre of the finger; the submaxillary glands in chancre of the lip or mouth; or the pre-auricular gland in chancre of the eyelid or forehead.In consequence of their divergence from the typical chancre, and of their being often met with in persons who, from age, surroundings, or moral character, are unlikely subjects of venereal disease, the true nature of erratic chancres is often overlooked until the persistence of the lesion, its want of resemblance to anything else, or the onset of constitutional symptoms, determines the diagnosis of syphilis.A solitary, indolent sore occurring on the lip, eyelid, finger, or nipple, which does not heal but tends to increase in size, and is associated with induration and enlargement of the adjacent glands, is most likely to be the primary lesion of syphilis. ]From  A System of Syphilis , vol.After the dying away of the secondary manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the patient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called  reminders .These usually consist of relapses of certain of the affections of the skin, mouth, or throat, already described.In the skin, they may assume the form of peeling patches in the palms, or may appear as spreading and confluent circles of a scaly papular eruption, which if neglected may lead to the formation of fissures and superficial ulcers.Less frequently there is a relapse of the eye affections, or of paralytic symptoms from disease of the cerebral arteries.Tertiary Syphilis.While the manifestations of primary and secondary syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.Reference may be made to the  relapsing false indurated chancre , described by Hutchinson and by Fournier, as it may be the source of difficulty in diagnosis.A patient who has had an infecting chancre one or more years before, may present a slightly raised induration on the penis at or close to the site of his original sore.This relapsed induration is often so like that of a primary chancre that it is impossible to distinguish between them, except by the history.If there has been a recent exposure to venereal infection, it is liable to be regarded as the primary lesion of a second attack of syphilis, but the further progress shows that neither bullet-buboes nor secondary manifestations develop.These facts, together with the disappearance of the induration under treatment, make it very likely that the lesion is really gummatous in character.INHERITED SYPHILIS One of the most striking features of syphilis is that it may be transmitted from infected parents to their offspring, the children exhibiting the manifestations that characterise the acquired form of the disease.At or near puberty there is frequently observed an affection of the eyes, known as  chronic interstitial keratitis , the relationship of which to inherited syphilis was first established by Hutchinson.It occurs between the ages of six and sixteen years, and usually affects one eye before the other.It commences as a diffuse haziness or steaminess near the centre of the cornea, and as it spreads the entire cornea assumes the appearance of ground glass.The chief complaint is of dimness of sight, which may almost amount to blindness, but there is little pain or photophobia; a certain amount of conjunctival and ciliary congestion is usually present, and there may be  iritis  in addition.The cornea, or parts of it, may become of a deep pink or salmon colour from the formation in it of new blood vessels.The affection may last for from eighteen months to two years.These appearances are commonly associated with the name of Hutchinson, who first described them.Affecting as they do the permanent teeth, they are not available for diagnosis until the child is over eight years of age.Henry Moon drew attention to a change in the first molars; these are reduced in size and dome-shaped through dwarfing of the central tubercle of each cusp.Diagnosis of Inherited Syphilis.When there is a typical eruption on the buttocks and snuffles there is no difficulty in recognising the disease.When, however, the rash is scanty or is obscured by co-existing eczema, most reliance should be placed on the distribution of the eruption, on the brown stains which are left after it has passed off, on the presence of condylomata, and of fissuring and scarring at the angles of the mouth.While a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may therefore be described as  permanent signs of the inherited disease : Dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded; radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction of the hard palate; Hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis; deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata; ""sabre-blade"" or other deformity of the tibia.The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.In 1837, Colles of Dublin stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the disease.This doctrine, which is known as  Colles' law , is generally accepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.The older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the disease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as it does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.It should be added, however, that the contagiousness of inherited syphilis is denied by some observers, who affirm that, when syphilitic infants prove infective, the disease has been really acquired at or soon after birth.Hutchinson insisted on the fact that there is little bad health in the general community that can be attributed to inherited syphilis.Treatment.Arsenical injections are as beneficial in the inherited as in the acquired disease.An infant the subject of inherited syphilis should, if possible, be nursed by its mother, and failing this it should be fed by hand.In infants at the breast, the drug may be given to the mother; in others, it is administered in the same manner as already described only in smaller doses.On the first appearance of syphilitic manifestations it should be given 0.05 grm, novarsenbillon, injected into the deep subcutaneous tissues every week for six weeks, followed by one year's mercurial inunction a piece of mercurial ointment the size of a pea being inserted under the infant's binder.A similar condition was described by Jonathan Hutchinson as being met with in the domestic animals.If causing disfigurement, the mass of fat may be removed by operation.Lipoma in other Situations.The  periosteal lipoma  is usually congenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a projecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles an angioma or a lymphangioma.The  subserous lipoma  arises from the extra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it tends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give rise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal fat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial openings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a  fatty hernia .A  subsynovial lipoma  grows from the fat surrounding the synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving rise to the symptoms of loose body.A more exuberant and rapidly growing form of epithelial cancer, described by Hutchinson as the  crateriform ulcer , commences on the face as a small red pimple which rapidly develops into an elevated mass shaped like a bee-hive, and breaks down in the centre.Epithelioma may develop anywhere on the body in relation to long-standing ulcers, especially that resulting from a burn or from lupus; this form usually presents an exuberant outgrowth of epidermis not unlike a cauliflower.An interesting example of epithelioma has been described by Neve of Kashmir.The natives in that province are in the habit of carrying a fire-basket suspended from the waist, which often burns the skin and causes a chronic ulcer, and many of these ulcers become the seat of epithelioma, due, in Neve's opinion, to the actual contact of the sooty pan with the skin.The term  trade epithelioma  has been applied to that form met with in those who follow certain occupations, such as paraffin workers and chimney-sweeps.The most recent member of this group is the  X-ray carcinoma , which is met with in those who are constantly exposed to the irritation of the X-rays; there is first a chronic dermatitis with warty overgrowth of the surface epithelium, pigmentation, and the formation of fissures and warts.A remarkable form of  unilateral hypertrophy and diffuse osteoma of the skull , following the distribution of the fifth nerve, has seen described by Jonathan Hutchinson and Alexis Thomson.Chondroma.Cartilaginous tumours, apart from those giving rise to multiple exostoses, grow from the long bones and from the scapula, ilium, ribs, or jaws.They usually project from the surface of the bone, and may attain an enormous size; sometimes they grow in the interior of a bone, the so-called  enchondroma .The hyaline cartilage composing the tumour frequently undergoes myxomatous degeneration, resulting in the formation of a glairy, semi-fluid jelly, and if this change takes place throughout the tumour it comes to resemble a cyst.On the other hand, the cartilage may undergo calcification or ossification."

Sprain and Partial Rupture of Muscle|"Sprain and Partial Rupture of Muscle.This lesion consists in overstretching and partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle or its aponeurosis.It is of common occurrence in athletes and in those who follow laborious occupations.It may follow upon a single or repeated effort especially in those who are out of training.Familiar examples of muscular sprain are the ""labourer's"" or ""golfer's back,"" affecting the latissimus dorsi or the sacrospinalis (erector spina); the ""tennis-player's elbow,"" and the ""sculler's sprain,"" affecting the muscles and ligaments about the elbow; the ""angler's elbow,"" affecting the common origin of the extensors and supinators; the ""sprinter's sprain,"" affecting the flexors of the hip; and the ""jumper's and dancer's sprain,"" affecting the muscles of the calf.The patient complains of pain, often sudden in onset, of tenderness on pressure, and of inability to carry out the particular movement by which the sprain was produced."
the ulnar border|The prominence of the tendon, which normally forms the ulnar border of the snuff-box, disappears.This lesion is chiefly met with in drummer-boys and is the cause of drummer's palsy.The only chance of restoring function is in uniting the ruptured tendon by open operation.Avulsion of Tendons.This is a rare injury, in which the tendons of a finger or toe are torn from their attachments along with a portion of the digit concerned.In the hand, it is usually brought about by the fingers being caught in the reins of a runaway horse, or being seized in a horse's teeth, or in machinery.
aponeuroses|"It would appear to involve mainly the fibrous tissue of muscles, although it may extend from this to aponeuroses, ligaments, periosteum, and the sheaths of nerves.The term  fibrositis  was applied to it by Gowers in 1904.In  lumbago   lumbo-sacral fibrositis  the pain is usually located over the sacrum, the sacro-iliac joint, or the aponeurosis of the lumbar muscles on one or both sides.The amount of tenderness varies, and so long as the patient is still he is free from pain.The slightest attempt to alter his position, however, is attended by pain, which may be so severe as to render him helpless for the moment.The pain is most marked on rising from the stooping or sitting posture, and may extend down the back of the hip, especially if, as is commonly the case, lumbago and gluteal fibrosis coexist.A similar condition may implicate the fascia lata of the thigh, or the calf muscles and their aponeuroses  crural fibrositis .In  painful stiff-neck , or ""rheumatic torticollis,"" the pain is located in one side of the neck, and is excited by some inadvertent movement.The head is held stiffly on one side as in wry-neck, the patient contracting the sterno-mastoid.There may be tenderness over the vertebral spines or in the lines of the cervical nerves, and the sterno-mastoid may undergo atrophy.This affection is more often met with in children.In  pleurodynia   intercostal fibrositis  the pain is in the line of the intercostal nerves, and is excited by movement of the chest, as in coughing, or by any bodily exertion."
Llewellyn and Jones|"If untreated, the morbid process may implicate the sheath of the sciatic nerve and cause genuine sciatic neuralgia (Llewellyn and Jones).A similar condition may implicate the fascia lata of the thigh, or the calf muscles and their aponeuroses  crural fibrositis .In  painful stiff-neck , or ""rheumatic torticollis,"" the pain is located in one side of the neck, and is excited by some inadvertent movement.The head is held stiffly on one side as in wry-neck, the patient contracting the sterno-mastoid.There may be tenderness over the vertebral spines or in the lines of the cervical nerves, and the sterno-mastoid may undergo atrophy.This affection is more often met with in children."

latissimus|"Familiar examples of muscular sprain are the ""labourer's"" or ""golfer's back,"" affecting the latissimus dorsi or the sacrospinalis (erector spina); the ""tennis-player's elbow,"" and the ""sculler's sprain,"" affecting the muscles and ligaments about the elbow; the ""angler's elbow,"" affecting the common origin of the extensors and supinators; the ""sprinter's sprain,"" affecting the flexors of the hip; and the ""jumper's and dancer's sprain,"" affecting the muscles of the calf.The patient complains of pain, often sudden in onset, of tenderness on pressure, and of inability to carry out the particular movement by which the sprain was produced.The disability varies in different cases, and it may incapacitate the patient from following his occupation or sport for weeks or, if imperfectly treated, even for months.The  treatment  consists in resting the muscle from the particular effort concerned in the production of the sprain, in gently exercising it in other directions, in the use of massage, and the induction of hyperamia by means of heat.In neglected cases, that is, where the muscle has not been exercised, the patient shrinks from using it and the disablement threatens to be permanent; it is sometimes said that adhesions have formed and that these interfere with the recovery of function.The condition may be overcome by graduated movements or by a sudden forcible movement under an anasthetic.The muscles of the back, especially the trapezius and latissimus, are the first to be affected, and the initial complaint is limitation of movement.The affected muscles show swellings which are rounded or oval, firm and elastic, sharply defined, without tenderness and without discoloration of the overlying skin.Skiagrams show that a considerable deposit of lime salts may precede the formation of bone, as is seen in Fig.111.In course of time the vertebral column becomes rigid, the head is bent forward, the hips are flexed, and abduction and other movements of the arms are limited.The disease progresses by fits and starts, until all the striped muscles of the body are replaced by bone, and all movements, even those of the jaws, are abolished."
Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths|Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths.These closely resemble the syphilitic affections of the synovial membrane of joints.During the secondary period the lesion usually consists in effusion into the sheath; gummata are met with during the tertiary period.Arborescent lipoma has been found in the sheaths of tendons about the wrist and ankle, sometimes in a multiple and symmetrical form, unattended by symptoms and disappearing under anti-syphilitic treatment.Tumours of Tendon Sheaths.Innocent tumours, such as  lipoma ,  fibroma , and  myxoma , are rare.

Anatomy Normal and adventitious bursa Injuries: Bursal     hamatoma DISEASES: Infective bursitis; Traumatic or trade     bursitis; Bursal hydrops; Solid bursal tumour; Gonorrhœal and     suppurative forms of bursitis; Tuberculous and syphilitic     disease Tumours  Diseases of individual bursa in the upper and     lower extremities .A bursa is a closed sac lined by endothelium and containing synovia.Some are normally present for instance, that between the skin and the patella, and that between the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus and the great trochanter.Adventitious bursa  are developed as a result of abnormal pressure for example, over the tarsal bones in cases of club-foot.Injuries of Bursa.As a result of contusion, especially in bleeders, hamorrhage may occur into the cavity of a bursa and give rise to a  bursal hamatoma ."
ligamentum|"The bursa  between the ligamentum patella and the tibia  is rarely the seat of disease.When it is, there is pain and tenderness referred to the ligament, the patient is unable to extend the limb completely, the tuberosity of the tibia is apparently enlarged, and there is a fluctuating swelling on either side of the ligament, most marked in the extended position of the limb.Of the numerous bursa in the popliteal space, that  between the semi-membranosus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius  is most frequently the seat of disease, which is usually of the nature of a simple hydrops, forming a fluctuating egg-or sausage-shaped swelling at the medial side of the popliteal space.It is flaccid in the flexed, and tense in the extended position.As a rule it causes little inconvenience, and may be left alone.Otherwise it should be dissected out, and if, as is frequently the case, there is a communication with the knee-joint, this should be closed with sutures.Intra-articular ligaments, such as the ligamentum teres in the hip, are usually worn away and disappear.The surrounding muscles undergo atrophy, tendons become adherent to their sheaths and may be ossified, and the sheaths of nerves may be involved by the cicatricial changes in the surrounding tissues.The X-ray appearances of arthritis deformans  necessarily vary with the type of the disease and the joint affected; in the joints of the fingers there is a narrowing of the spaces between the articular ends of the bones as a result of absorption of the articular cartilage, and rarefaction of the cancellous tissue in the vicinity of the joints; in the larger joints there is ""lipping"" of the articular margins, osteophytes, and other evidence of abnormal ossification in and around the joint.Eburnation of the articular surfaces is shown by increase in the density of the shadow of the bone in the areas affected.Treatment.Treatment is for the most part limited to the relief of symptoms."
gastrocnemius|"As examples may be cited the rupture of the quadriceps extensor in attempting to regain the balance when falling backwards; of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, or tendo-calcaneus in jumping or dancing; of the adductors of the thigh in gripping a horse when it swerves ""rider's sprain""; of the abdominal muscles in vomiting, and of the biceps in sudden movements of the arm.Sometimes the effort is one that would scarcely be thought likely to rupture a muscle, as in the case recorded by Pagenstecher, where a professional athlete, while sitting at table, ruptured his biceps in a sudden effort to catch a falling glass.It would appear that the rupture is brought about not so much by the contraction of the muscle concerned, as by the contraction of the antagonistic muscles taking place before that of the muscle which undergoes rupture is completed.The violent muscular contractions of epilepsy, tetanus, or delirium rarely cause rupture.The  clinical features  are usually characteristic.The patient experiences a sudden pain, with the sensation of being struck with a whip, and of something giving way; sometimes a distant snap is heard.We have observed this form of tuberculous disease in the gastrocnemius and in the psoas in the latter muscle apart from tuberculous disease in the vertebra.Tendinitis.German authors describe an inflammation of tendon as distinguished from inflammation of its sheath, and give it the name tendinitis.It is met with most frequently in the tendo-calcaneus in gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon, especially during cold and damp weather.There is localised pain which is aggravated by walking, and the tendon is sensitive and swollen from a little above its insertion to its junction with the muscle.Gouty nodules may form in its substance.Of the numerous bursa in the popliteal space, that  between the semi-membranosus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius  is most frequently the seat of disease, which is usually of the nature of a simple hydrops, forming a fluctuating egg-or sausage-shaped swelling at the medial side of the popliteal space.It is flaccid in the flexed, and tense in the extended position.As a rule it causes little inconvenience, and may be left alone.Otherwise it should be dissected out, and if, as is frequently the case, there is a communication with the knee-joint, this should be closed with sutures.An adventitious bursa may form over the  lateral malleolus , especially in tailors, giving rise to the condition known as ""tailor's ankle"" (Fig.117)."
the subcalcanean bursa|"The bursa that is sometimes met with on the under aspect of the calcaneus  the subcalcanean bursa  when inflamed, gives rise to pain and tenderness in the sole of the foot.This affection may be associated with a spinous projection from the bone, which is capable of being recognised in a skiagram.The soft parts of the heel are turned forwards as a flap, the bursa is dissected out, and the projection of bone, if present, is removed.The enlargement of adventitious bursa over the head of the first metatarsal in hallux valgus; over the tarsus, metatarsus, and digits in the different forms of club-foot; over the angular projection in Pott's disease of the spine; over the end of the bone in amputation stumps, and over hard tumours such as chondroma and osteoma, are described elsewhere.CHAPTER XX DISEASES OF BONE

Fragilitas|DISEASES OF BONE Definition of terms Pyogenic diseases:      Acute osteomyelitis and periostitis ;  Chronic and relapsing     osteomyelitis ;  Abscess of bone  Tuberculous disease Syphilitic     disease Hydatids; Rickets; Osteomalacia Ostitis deformans of     Paget Osteomyelitis fibrosa Affections of bones in diseases of     the nervous system Fragilitas ossium Tumours and cysts of bone.Surgical Anatomy.During the period of growth, a long bone such as the tibia consists of a shaft or  diaphysis , and two extremities or  epiphyses .So long as growth continues there intervenes between the shaft and each of the epiphyses a disc of actively growing cartilage  the epiphysial cartilage ; and at the junction of this cartilage with the shaft is a zone of young, vascular, spongy bone known as the  metaphysis  or  epiphysial junction .The shaft is a cylinder of compact bone enclosing the medullary canal, which is filled with yellow marrow.The extremities, which include the ossifying junctions, consist of spongy bone, the spaces of which are filled with red marrow.Osteogenesis Imperfecta ,  Fragilitas Ossium , or  Congenital Osteopsathyrosis .These terms are used to describe a condition in which an undue fragility of the bones dates from intra-uterine life.It may occur in several members of the same family.In severe cases, intra-uterine fractures occur, and during parturition fresh fractures are almost sure to be produced, so that at birth there is a combination of recent fractures and old fractures united and partly united, with bendings and thickenings of the bones.Large areas of the cranial vault may remain membranous.After birth the predisposition to fracture continues, the bones are easily broken, the fractures are attended with little or no pain, the crepitus is soft, and although union may take place, it may be delayed and be attended with excess of callus.
EAM  Diseases|INFECTIONS THROUGH THE BLOOD-STREAM  Diseases caused by the Staphylococcus Aureus.As the majority of pyogenic diseases are due to infection with the staphylococcus aureus, these will be described first.Acute osteomyelitis  is a suppurative process beginning in the marrow and tending to spread to the periosteum.The disease is common in children, but is rare after the skeleton has attained maturity.Boys are affected more often than girls, in the proportion of three to one, probably because they are more liable to exposure, to injury, and to violent exertion.Etiology.

Staphylococci|Staphylococci gain access to the blood-stream in various ways, it may be through the skin or through a mucous surface.Such conditions as, for example, a blow, some extra exertion such as a long walk, or exposure to cold, as in wading, may act as localising factors.The long bones are chiefly affected, and the commonest sites are: either end of the tibia and the lower end of the femur; the other bones of the skeleton are affected in rare instances.Pathology.The disease commences and is most intense in the marrow of the ossifying junction at one end of the diaphysis; it may commence at both ends simultaneously  bipolar osteomyelitis ; or, commencing at one end, may spread to the other.The changes observed are those of intense engorgement of the marrow, going on to greenish-yellow purulent infiltration.
General Complications|General Complications.In some cases a  multiplicity of lesions  in the bones and joints imparts to the disease the features of pyamia.The occurrence of endocarditis, as indicated by alterations in the heart sounds and the development of murmurs, may cause widespread infective embolism, and metastatic suppurations in the kidneys, heart-wall, and lungs, as well as in other bones and joints than those primarily affected.The secondary suppurations are liable to be overlooked unless sought for, as they are rarely attended with much pain.In these multiple forms of osteomyelitis the toxamic symptoms predominate; the patient is dull and listless, or he may be restless and talkative, or actually delirious.The tongue is dry and coated, the lips and teeth are covered with sordes, the motions are loose and offensive, and may be passed involuntarily.
Sequela of Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis|Sequela of Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis.The commonest sequel is the presence of a sequestrum with one or more discharging sinuses; owing to the abundant formation of scar tissue these sinuses have rigid edges which are usually depressed and adherent to the bone.The Recognition and Removal of Sequestra.So long as there is dead bone there will be suppuration from the granulations lining the cavity in which it lies, and a discharge of pus from the sinuses, so that the mere persistence of discharge after an attack of osteomyelitis, is presumptive evidence of the occurrence of necrosis.Where there are one or more sinuses, the passage of a probe which strikes bare bone affords corroboration of the view that the bone has perished.When the dead bone has been separated from the living, the X-rays yield the most exact information.

Circumscribed Abscess|"Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.In the initial stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and suppuration.An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative process is spreading.The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the surface.Circumscribed Abscess of Bone ""Brodie's Abscess.""The most important form of relapsing osteomyelitis is the circumscribed abscess of bone first described by Benjamin Brodie.It is usually met with in young adults, but we have met with it in patients over fifty.Several years may intervene between the original attack of osteomyelitis and the onset of symptoms of abscess.Morbid Anatomy.The abscess is nearly always situated in the central axis of the bone in the region of the ossifying junction, although cases are occasionally met with in which it lies nearer the middle of the shaft."
un-united fract|There still remain those forms of osteomyelitis which result from infection through a wound involving the bone for example, compound fractures, gun-shot injuries, osteotomies, amputations, resections, or operations for un-united fracture.In all of these the marrow is exposed to infection by such organisms as are present in the wound.A similar form of osteomyelitis may occur apart from a wound for example, infection may spread to the jaws from lesions of the mouth; to the skull, from lesions of the scalp or of the cranial bones themselves such as a syphilitic gumma or a sarcoma which has fungated externally; or to the petrous temporal, from suppuration in the middle ear.The most common is an osteomyelitis commencing in the marrow exposed in a wound infected with pyogenic organisms.In amputation stumps, fungating granulations protrude from the sawn end of the bone, and if necrosis takes place, the sequestrum is annular, affecting the cross-section of the bone at the saw-line; or tubular, extending up the shaft, and tapering off above.The periosteum is more easily detached, is thicker than normal, and is actively engaged in forming bone.
the tubercle bacil|"There is evidence that a  mixed infection  that is, the introduction of more than one species of organism, for example, the tubercle bacillus and a pyogenic staphylococcus increases the severity of the resulting disease.If one of the varieties gain the ascendancy, the poisons produced by the others so devitalise the tissue cells, and diminish their power of resistance, that the virulence of the most active organisms is increased.On the other hand, there is reason to believe that the products of certain organisms antagonise one another for example, an attack of erysipelas may effect the cure of a patch of tuberculous lupus.Lastly, in patients suffering from chronic wasting diseases, bacteria may invade the internal organs by the blood-stream in enormous numbers and with great rapidity, during the period of extreme debility which shortly precedes death.The discovery of such collections of organisms on post-mortem examination may lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn as to the cause of death.Results of Bacterial Growth.Others, on the contrary for example, the tubercle bacillus and the organism of acute osteomyelitis although frequently remaining localised at the seat of inoculation, tend to pass to distant parts, lodging in the capillaries of joints, bones, kidney, or lungs, and there producing their deleterious effects.In the human subject, multiplication in the blood-stream does not occur to any great extent.In some general acute pyogenic infections, such as osteomyelitis, cellulitis, etc., pure cultures of staphylococci or of streptococci may be obtained from the blood.In pneumococcal and typhoid infections, also, the organisms may be found in the blood.It is by the vital changes they bring about in the parts where they settle that micro-organisms disturb the health of the patient.In deriving nourishment from the complex organic compounds in which they nourish, the organisms evolve, probably by means of a ferment, certain chemical products of unknown composition, but probably colloidal in nature, and known as  toxins .It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.Most of these will receive further mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.Leucocytosis.Most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other pathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number of leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system.This condition of the blood, which is known as  leucocytosis , is believed to be due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the bone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and destruction of the invading organisms or toxins.To increase the resisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial leucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of nucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent.CHRONIC SUPPURATION While it is true that a chronic pyogenic abscess is sometimes met with for example, in the breast and in the marrow of long bones in the great majority of instances the formation of a chronic or cold abscess is the result of the action of the tubercle bacillus.It is therefore more convenient to study this form of suppuration with tuberculosis (p. 139).SINUS AND FISTULA  Sinus.A sinus is a track leading from a focus of suppuration to a cutaneous or mucous surface.It usually represents the path by which the discharge escapes from an abscess cavity that has been prevented from closing completely, either from mechanical causes or from the persistent formation of discharge which must find an exit.A sinus is lined by granulation tissue, and when it is of long standing the opening may be dragged below the level of the surrounding skin by contraction of the scar tissue around it.GLANDERS Glanders is due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus mallei , which resembles the tubercle bacillus, save that it is somewhat shorter and broader, and does not stain by Gram's method.It requires higher temperatures for its cultivation than the tubercle bacillus, and its growth on potato is of a characteristic chocolate-brown colour, with a greenish-yellow ring at the margin of the growth.The bacillus mallei retains its vitality for long periods under ordinary conditions, but is readily killed by heat and chemical agents.It does not form spores.Clinical Features.Both in the lower animals and in man the bacillus gives rise to two distinct types of disease  acute glanders , and  chronic glanders  or  farcy .It requires higher temperatures for its cultivation than the tubercle bacillus, and its growth on potato is of a characteristic chocolate-brown colour, with a greenish-yellow ring at the margin of the growth.The bacillus mallei retains its vitality for long periods under ordinary conditions, but is readily killed by heat and chemical agents.It does not form spores.Clinical Features.Both in the lower animals and in man the bacillus gives rise to two distinct types of disease  acute glanders , and  chronic glanders  or  farcy .Acute Glanders is most commonly met with in the horse and in other equine animals, horned cattle being immune.In the vast majority of cases the tubercle bacillus gains entrance to the body by way of the mucous surfaces, the organisms being either inhaled or swallowed; those inhaled are mostly derived from the human subject, those swallowed, from cattle.Bacilli, whether inhaled or swallowed, are especially apt to lodge about the pharynx and pass to the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue and tonsils, and by way of the lymph vessels to the glands.The glands most frequently infected in this way are the cervical glands, and those within the cavity of the chest particularly the bronchial glands at the root of the lung.From these, infection extends at any later period in life to the bones, joints, and internal organs.There is reason to believe that the organisms may lie in a dormant condition for an indefinite period in these glands, and only become active long afterwards, when some depression of the patient's health produces conditions which favour their growth.When the organisms become active in this way, the tuberculous tissue undergoes softening and disintegration, and the infective material, by bursting into an adjacent vein, may enter the blood-stream, in which it is carried to distant parts of the body.The changes that ensue resemble in character those in other tissues, and the extent of the destruction varies according to the way in which the tubercle bacillus and the marrow interact upon one another.The granulation tissue may undergo caseation and liquefaction, or may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue ""encysted tubercle.""Sometimes the tuberculous granulation tissue spreads in the marrow, assuming the characters of a diffuse infiltration diffuse tuberculous osteomyelitis.The trabecular framework of the bone undergoes erosion and absorption rarefying ostitis and either disappears altogether or only irregular fragments or sequestra of microscopic dimensions remain in the area affected.Less frequently the trabecular framework is added to by the formation of new bone, resulting in a remarkable degree of sclerosis, and if, following upon this, there is caseation of the tubercle and death of the affected portion of bone, there results a sequestrum often of considerable size and characteristic shape, which, because of the sclerosis and surrounding endarteritis, is exceedingly slow in separating.When the sequestrum involves an articular surface it is often wedge-shaped; in other situations it is rounded or truncated and lies in the long axis of the medullary canal (Fig."
dactylitis|"Gummatous disease is frequently observed also in the flat bones of the skull, in the bones of the hand, as syphilitic dactylitis, and in the bones of the forearm and leg.When the tibia is affected the disease is frequently bilateral, and may assume the form of gummatous ulcers and sinuses.In later years the tibia may present alterations in shape resulting from antecedent gummatous disease for example, nodular thickenings of the shaft, flattening of the crest, or a more uniform increase in thickness and length of the shaft of the bone, which, when it is curved in addition, is described as the ""sabre-blade"" deformity.Among lesions of the viscera, mention should be made of gumma of the testis, which causes the organ to become enlarged, uneven, and indurated.This has even been observed in infants a few months old.Occasionally a syphilitic child suffers from a succession of these gummatous lesions with resulting ill-health, and, it may be, waxy disease of the internal organs; on the other hand, it may recover and present no further manifestations of the inherited taint.When growing in the interior of a bone it causes a spindle-shaped enlargement of the shaft, which in the case of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble the dactylitis resulting from tubercle or syphilis.A chondroma appears as a clear area in a skiagram.A  skiagram  of a bone in which there is a chondroma shows a clear rounded area in the position of the tumour, which must be differentiated from similar clear areas due to other kinds of tumour, especially the myeloma; when it has undergone calcification or ossification, it gives a shadow as dark as bone.Treatment.In view of the unstable quality of the chondroma, especially of its liability to become malignant, it should be removed as soon as it is recognised.In those projecting from the surface of a bone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed.Tuberculous dactylitis  is the name applied to a diffuse form of the disease as it affects the phalanges, metacarpal or metatarsal bones.The lesion presents, on a small scale, all the anatomical changes that have been described as occurring in the medulla of the tibia or ulna, and they are easily followed in skiagrams.A periosteal type of dactylitis is also met with.The  clinical features  are those of a spindle-shaped swelling of a finger or toe, indolent, painless, and interfering but little with the function of the digit.Recovery may eventually occur without suppuration, but it is common to have the formation of a cold abscess, which bursts and forms one or more sinuses.It may be difficult to differentiate tuberculous dactylitis from the enlargement of the phalanges in inherited syphilis (syphilitic dactylitis), especially when the tuberculous lesion occurs in a child who is the subject of inherited syphilis.A periosteal type of dactylitis is also met with.The  clinical features  are those of a spindle-shaped swelling of a finger or toe, indolent,

by observing the results of the tuberculin test or the effects of anti-syphilitic treatment.Sarcoma of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may closely resemble a dactylitis both clinically and in skiagrams, but it is rare.It may be difficult to differentiate tuberculous dactylitis from the enlargement of the phalanges in inherited syphilis (syphilitic dactylitis), especially when the tuberculous lesion

it is rare.Treatment.Recovery under conservative measures is not uncommon, and the functional results are usually better than those following upon operative treatment, although in either case the affected finger is liable to be dwarfed (Fig.129).Sarcoma of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may closely resemble a dactylitis both clinically and in skiagrams, but it is rare.Treatment.Recovery under conservative measures is not uncommon, and the functional results are usually better than those following upon operative treatment, although in either case the affected finger is liable to be dwarfed (Fig.129).The finger should be immobilised in a splint, and a Bier's bandage applied to the upper arm.Operative interference is indicated if a cold abscess develops, if there is a persistent sinus, or if a sequestrum has formed, a point upon which information is obtained by examination with the X-rays.Syphilitic dactylitis  is met with chiefly in children.It may affect any of the fingers or toes, but is commonest in the first phalanx of the index-finger or of the thumb.Several fingers may be attacked at the same time or in succession.The lesion consists in a gummatous infiltration of the soft parts surrounding the phalanx, or a gummatous osteomyelitis, but there is practically no tendency to break down and discharge, or to the formation of a sequestrum as is so common in tuberculous dactylitis.The finger becomes the seat of a swelling, which is more evident on the dorsal aspect, and, according to the distribution and extent of the disease, it is acorn-shaped, fusiform, or cylindrical.It is firm and elastic, and usually painless.The lesion consists in a gummatous infiltration of the soft parts surrounding the phalanx, or a gummatous osteomyelitis, but there is

especially if the joints are involved.In its early stages the disease is amenable to anti-syphilitic treatment, and complete recovery is the rule.HYDATID DISEASE This rare disease results from the lodgment of the embryos of the tania echinoccus, which are conveyed to the marrow by the blood-stream."
Evanescent|Evanescent periostitis  is met with in acquired syphilis during the period of the early skin eruptions.The patient complains, especially at night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibia, or ulna.Localised tenderness is elicited on pressure, and there is slight swelling, which, however, rarely amounts to what may be described as a  periosteal node .In the later stages of acquired syphilis,  gummatous periostitis and osteomyelitis  occur, and are characterised by the formation in the periosteum and marrow of circumscribed gummata or of a diffuse gummatous infiltration.The framework of the bone is rarefied in the area immediately involved, and sclerosed in the parts beyond.If the gummatous tissue degenerates and breaks down, and especially if the overlying skin is perforated and septic infection is superadded, the bone disintegrates and exhibits the condition known as  syphilitic caries ; sometimes a portion of bone has its blood supply so far interfered with that it dies  syphilitic necrosis .
Jacksonian|On the inner surface of the skull, the formation of gummatous tissue may cause pressure on the brain and give rise to intense pain in the head, Jacksonian epilepsy, or paralysis, the symptoms varying with the seat and extent of the disease.The cranial nerves may be pressed upon at the base, especially at their points of exit, and this gives rise to symptoms of irritation or paralysis in the area of distribution of the nerves affected.In the septum of the nose, the nasal bones, and the hard palate , gummatous disease causes ulceration, which, beginning in the mucous membrane, spreads to the bones, and being complicated with septic infection leads to caries and necrosis.In the nose, the disease is attended with stinking discharge (ozœna), the extrusion of portions of dead bone, and subsequently with deformity characterised by loss of the bridge of the nose; in the palate, it is common to have a perforation, so that the air escapes through the nose in speaking, giving to the voice a characteristic nasal tone.Syphilitic disease of the tibia  may be taken as the type of the affection as it occurs  in the long bones .Gummatous disease in the periosteum may be localised and result in the formation of a well-defined node, or the whole shaft may become the seat of an irregular nodular enlargement (Fig.
Craniotabes|Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.In the majority of cases the child recovers from these early manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an indefinite period of good health.On the other hand, when it attains the age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.Later Lesions.In the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the later manifestations may take the form of localised gummata, which tend to break down and form ulcers, on the leg for example, or of a spreading gummatous infiltration which is also liable to ulcerate, leaving disfiguring scars, especially on the face.Craniotabes , in which the flat bones of the skull undergo absorption in patches, was formerly regarded as syphilitic, but it is now known to result from prolonged malnutrition from any cause.Bossing of the skull  resulting in the formation of Parrot's nodes is also being withdrawn from the category of syphilitic affections.The lesions in infancy epiphysitis, bossing of the skull, and craniotabes have been referred to in the chapter on inherited syphilis.Epiphysitis or Syphilitic Perichondritis.The first of these terms is misleading, because the lesion involves the ossifying junction and the shaft of the bone, and the epiphysis only indirectly.The young bone is replaced by granulation tissue, so that large clear areas are seen with the X-rays.
craniotabes|"The conditions of the skull known as Parrot's nodes or bosses, and craniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited syphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety children, from other causes.The  bosses  result from the heaping up of new spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped symmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either side of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove the ""natiform skull.""The bosses disappear in time, but the skull may remain permanently altered in shape, the frontal and parietal eminences appearing unduly prominent.The term  craniotabes  is applied when the bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow.Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.The term  craniotabes  is applied when the bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow.Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.In the majority of cases the child recovers from these early manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an indefinite period of good health.On the other hand, when it attains the age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.Later Lesions.The lesions in infancy epiphysitis, bossing of the skull, and craniotabes have been referred to in the chapter on inherited syphilis.Epiphysitis or Syphilitic Perichondritis.The first of these terms is misleading, because the lesion involves the ossifying junction and the shaft of the bone, and the epiphysis only indirectly.The young bone is replaced by granulation tissue, so that large clear areas are seen with the X-rays.The symptoms are referred to the joint, because it is there that the muscles are inserted and drag on the perichondrium when movement occurs; swelling is most marked in the vicinity of the joint, and it may be added to by effusion into the synovial cavity.The baby, usually under six months, is noticed to be feverish and fretful and to cry when touched.In the flat bones of the skull, the absorption may result in the entire disappearance of areas of bone, leaving a membrane which dimples like thin cardboard under the pressure of the finger a condition known as  craniotabes .Changes in the Skeleton before the Child is able to walk.The fontanelles remain open until the end of the second year or longer, and the frontal and parietal eminences are unduly prominent.There is sometimes hydrocephalus, and the head is characteristically enlarged.The jaws are altered so that while the upper jaw is contracted into the shape of a  V , the lower jaw is square instead of rounded in outline, and the teeth do not oppose one another.In the  thorax , the chief feature may be the beading at the costo-chondral junctions, principally of the fifth and sixth ribs or its walls may be contracted, particularly if respiration is interfered with as a result of bronchial catarrh or adenoids."
fragilitas|CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES ATTENDED WITH LESIONS IN THE BONES These include rickets, scurvy-rickets, osteomalacia, ostitis deformans, osteomyelitis fibrosa, fragilitas ossium, and diseases of the nervous system.RICKETS Rickets or rachitis is a constitutional disease associated with disturbance of nutrition, and attended with changes in the skeleton.The disease is most common and most severe among the children of the poorer classes in large cities, who are improperly fed and are brought up in unhealthy surroundings.There is evidence that the most important factors in the causation of rickets are ill-health of the mother during pregnancy, and the administration to the child after its birth of food which is defective in animal fat, proteids, and salts of lime, or which contains these in such a form that they are not readily assimilated.The occurrence of the disease is favoured, and its features are aggravated, by imperfect oxygenation of the blood as the result of a deficiency of fresh air and sunlight, want of exercise, and by other conditions which prevail in the slums of large towns.Pathological Anatomy.
Rachitis Adolescentium  |Late Rickets  or  Rachitis Adolescentium  is met with at any age from nine to seventeen, and is generally believed to be due to a recrudescence of rickets which had been present in childhood.The disease is not attended with any disturbance of the general health; the pathological changes are the same as in infantile rickets, but are for the most part confined to the ossifying junctions, especially those which are most active during adolescence, for example at the knee-joint.The patient is easily tired, complains of pain in the bones, and, unless care is taken, deformity is liable to ensue.There can be no doubt that adolescent rickets plays an important part in the production of the deformities which occur at or near puberty, especially knock-knee and bow-knee.Scurvy-Rickets  or  Infantile Scurvy .This disease, described by Barlow and Cheadle, is met with in infants under two years who have been brought up upon sterilised or condensed milk and other proprietary foods, and is most common in the well-to-do classes.
Hamorrhages|Hamorrhages also occur into the skin, presenting the appearance of bruises, into the orbit and conjunctiva, and from the mucous membranes.The  treatment  consists in correcting the errors in diet.The infant should have a wet nurse or a plentiful supply of cow's milk in its natural state.Anti-scorbutics in the form of orange, lemon, or grape juice, and of potatoes bruised down in milk, may be given.Osteomalacia.The term osteomalacia includes a group of conditions, closely allied to rickets, in which the bones of adults become soft and yielding, so that they are unduly liable to bend or break.
conjunctiva|Grafts of  mucous membrane  are used to cover defects in the lip, cheek, and conjunctiva.The technique is similar to that employed in skin-grafting; the sources of mucous membrane are limited and the element of septic infection cannot always be excluded.Fat.Adipose tissue has a low vitality, but it is easily retained and it readily lends itself to transplantation.Portions of fat are often obtainable at operations from the omentum, for example, otherwise the subcutaneous fat of the buttock is the most accessible; it may be employed to fill up cavities of all kinds in order to obtain more rapid and sounder healing and also to remedy deformity, as in filling up a depression in the cheek or forehead.It is ultimately converted into ordinary connective tissue  pari passu  with the absorption of the fat.The conjunctiva also may be yellow.In the latter stages of the disease the pulse becomes small and fluttering; the tongue becomes dry and brown; sordes collect on the teeth; and a low muttering form of delirium supervenes.Secondary infection of the parotid gland frequently occurs, and gives rise to a suppurative parotitis.This condition is associated with severe pain, gradually extending from behind the angle of the jaw on to the face.There is also swelling over the gland, and eventually suppuration and sloughing of the gland tissue and overlying skin.Secondary abscesses in the lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or joints are often so insidious and painless in their development that they are only discovered accidentally.The infection may spread along the nasal duct to the conjunctiva.The middle ear also may become involved by spread along the auditory (Eustachian) tube.The lymph glands behind the angle of the jaw enlarge and become tender, and may suppurate from superadded infection.There is pain on swallowing, and often earache; and the patient speaks with a nasal accent.He becomes weak and anamic, and loses his appetite.There is often albuminuria.The chief complaint is of dimness of sight, which may almost amount to blindness, but there is little pain or photophobia; a certain amount of conjunctival and ciliary congestion is usually present, and there may be  iritis  in addition.The cornea, or parts of it, may become of a deep pink or salmon colour from the formation in it of new blood vessels.The affection may last for from eighteen months to two years.Complete recovery usually takes place, but slight opacities, especially in the site of former salmon patches, may persist, and the disease occasionally relapses.Choroiditis  and  retinitis  may also occur, and leave permanent changes easily recognised on examination with the ophthalmoscope.Among the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be mentioned gummatous disease in the  larynx and trachea , attended with ulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the  nervous system  which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.These points are often well illustrated in cases of black eye, where the blood effused under the conjunctiva is bright red, while that in the eyelids is almost black.In severe contusions associated with great tension of the skin for example, over the front of the tibia or around the ankle blisters often form on the surface and constitute a possible avenue of infection.When deeply situated, the blood tends to spread along the lines of least resistance, partly under the influence of gravity, passing under fascia, between muscles, along the sheaths of vessels, or in connective-tissue spaces, so that it may only reach the surface after some time, and at a considerable distance from the seat of injury.This fact is sometimes of importance in diagnosis, as, for example, in certain fractures of the base of the skull, where discoloration appears under the conjunctiva or behind the mastoid process some days after the accident.Blood extravasated deeply in the tissues gives rise to a firm, resistant, doughy swelling, in which there may be elicited on deep palpation a peculiar sensation, not unlike the crepitus of fracture.It frequently happens that, from the tearing of lymph vessels, serous fluid is extravasated, and a  lymphatic  or  serous cyst  may form.This fact is sometimes of importance in diagnosis, as, for example, in certain fractures of the base of the skull, where discoloration appears under the conjunctiva or behind the mastoid process some days after the accident.Blood extravasated deeply in the tissues gives rise to a firm, resistant, doughy swelling, in which there may be elicited on deep palpation a peculiar sensation, not unlike the crepitus of fracture.It frequently happens that, from the tearing of lymph vessels, serous fluid is extravasated, and a  lymphatic  or  serous cyst  may form.In all contusions accompanied by extravasation, there is marked swelling of the area involved, as well as pain and tenderness.The temperature may rise to 101° F., or, in the large extravasations that occur in bleeders, even higher a form of aseptic fever.The degree of shock is variable, but sudden syncope frequently results from severe bruises of the testicle, abdomen, or head, and occasionally marked nervous depression follows these injuries.Under the conjunctiva there are extravasations of bright red blood; and sublingual hamatoma has been observed (Beatson).The discoloration begins to fade within a few hours, and after the second or third day it disappears, without showing any of the chromatic changes which characterise a bruise.The sub-conjunctival ecchymosis, however, persists for several weeks and disappears like other extravasations.Apart from combating the shock, or dealing with concomitant injuries, no treatment is called for.DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations.It may be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic infective diseases of the urinary organs.The sub-conjunctival ecchymosis, however, persists for several weeks and disappears like other extravasations.Apart from combating the shock, or dealing with concomitant injuries, no treatment is called for.DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations.It may be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic infective diseases of the urinary organs.In the various forms of meningitis also, and in some cases of injury to the head, it is common; and it is sometimes met with after severe hamorrhage, and in cases of poisoning by such drugs as iodoform, cocain, or alcohol.Delirium may also, of course, be a symptom of insanity.Hamorrhages also occur into the skin, presenting the appearance of bruises, into the orbit and conjunctiva, and from the mucous membranes.The  treatment  consists in correcting the errors in diet.The infant should have a wet nurse or a plentiful supply of cow's milk in its natural state.Anti-scorbutics in the form of orange, lemon, or grape juice, and of potatoes bruised down in milk, may be given.Osteomalacia.The term osteomalacia includes a group of conditions, closely allied to rickets, in which the bones of adults become soft and yielding, so that they are unduly liable to bend or break.
New Growths|New Growths in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue.The  Angioma  has been described with diseases of blood vessels.Fibroma.Various types of fibroma occur in the skin.A soft pedunculated fibroma, about the size of a pea, is commonly met with, especially on the neck and trunk; it is usually solitary, and is easily removed with scissors.The multiple, soft fibroma known as  molluscum fibrosum , which depends upon a neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves, is described with the tumours of nerves.Osteomalacia associated with New Growths in the Skeleton.When  secondary cancer  is widely distributed throughout the skeleton, it is associated with softening of the bones, as a result of which they readily bend or break, and after death are easily cut with a knife.In the disease known as  multiple myeloma , the interior of the ribs, sternum, and bodies of the vertebra is occupied by a reddish gelatinous pulp, the structure of which resembles sarcoma; the bones are reduced to a mere shell, and may break on the slightest pressure; the urine contains albumose, a substance resembling albumen but coagulating at a comparatively low temperature (140° F.), and the coagulum is re-dissolved on boiling, and it is readily precipitated by hydrochloric acid (Bence-Jones).Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.
Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone|Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.In course of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance; it is at first devoid of lime salts, but later becomes calcified, so that the bones regain their rigidity.This formation of new bone is much in excess of the normal, the bones become large and bulky, their surfaces rough and uneven, their texture sclerosed in parts, and the medullary canal is frequently obliterated.These changes are well brought out in X-ray photographs.
Fragilitas Ossium|Osteogenesis Imperfecta ,  Fragilitas Ossium , or  Congenital Osteopsathyrosis .These terms are used to describe a condition in which an undue fragility of the bones dates from intra-uterine life.It may occur in several members of the same family.In severe cases, intra-uterine fractures occur, and during parturition fresh fractures are almost sure to be produced, so that at birth there is a combination of recent fractures and old fractures united and partly united, with bendings and thickenings of the bones.Large areas of the cranial vault may remain membranous.After birth the predisposition to fracture continues, the bones are easily broken, the fractures are attended with little or no pain, the crepitus is soft, and although union may take place, it may be delayed and be attended with excess of callus.
Periosteal|"Periosteal tuberculosis  is met with in the ribs, sternum, vertebral column, skull, and less frequently in the long bones of the limbs.It may originate in the periosteum, or may spread thence from the marrow, or from synovial membrane.In superficial bones , such as the sternum, the formation of tuberculous granulation tissue in the deeper layer of the periosteum, and its subsequent caseation and liquefaction, is attended by the insidious development of a doughy swelling, which is not as a rule painful, although tender on pressure.While the swelling often remains quiescent for some time, it tends to increase in size, to become boggy or fluctuating, and to assume the characters of a cold abscess.The pus perforates the fibrous layer of the periosteum, invading and infecting the overlying soft parts, its spread being influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues.The size of the abscess affords no indication of the extent of the bone lesion from which it originates.Periosteal tumours  are at first situated on one side of the bone, but as they grow they tend to surround it completely.Innocent periosteal tumours retain the outer fibrous layer as a capsule.Malignant tumours tend to perforate the periosteal capsule and invade the soft parts.Central  or  medullary tumours  as they increase in size replace the surrounding bone, and simultaneously new bone is formed on the surface; as this is in its turn absorbed, further bone is formed beneath the periosteum, so that in time the bone is increased in girth, and is said to be ""expanded"" by the growth in its interior.Primary Tumours Osteoma.When the tumour projects from the surface of a bone it is called an  exostosis ."
Multiple Exostoses|Multiple Exostoses.This disease, which, by custom, is still placed in the category of tumours, is to be regarded as a disorder of growth, dating from intra-uterine life and probably due to a disturbance in the function of the glands of internal secretion, the thyreoid being the one which is most likely to be at fault (Arthur Keith).The disorder of growth is confined to those elements of the skeleton where a core of bone formed in cartilage comes to be encased in a sheath of bone formed beneath the periosteum.To indicate this abnormality the name  diaphysial aclasis  has been employed by Arthur Keith at the suggestion of Morley Roberts.Bones formed entirely in cartilage are exempt, namely, the tarsal and carpal bones, the epiphyses of the long bones, the sternum, and the bodies of the vertebra.Bones formed entirely in membrane, that is, those of the face and of the cranial vault, are also exempt.
Morley Roberts|To indicate this abnormality the name  diaphysial aclasis  has been employed by Arthur Keith at the suggestion of Morley Roberts.Bones formed entirely in cartilage are exempt, namely, the tarsal and carpal bones, the epiphyses of the long bones, the sternum, and the bodies of the vertebra.Bones formed entirely in membrane, that is, those of the face and of the cranial vault, are also exempt.The disorder mainly affects the ossifying junctions of the long bones of the extremities, the vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border of the ilium.Clinically  the disease is attended with the gradual and painless development during childhood or adolescence of a number of tumours or irregular projections of bone, at the ends of the long bones, the vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border of the ilium.They exhibit a rough symmetry; they rarely attain any size; and they usually cease growing when the skeleton attains maturity the conversion of cartilage into bone being then completed.
leontiasis ossea|This rare affection was described by Virchow, and named leontiasis ossea because of the disfigurement to which it gives rise.It usually commences in adolescence as a diffuse overgrowth first of one and then of both maxilla; these bones are enlarged in all directions and project on the face, and the nasal fossa and the maxillary and frontal sinuses become filled up with bone, which encroaches also on the orbital cavities.In addition to the hideous deformity, the patient suffers from blocking of the nose, loss of smell, and protrusion of the eyes, sometimes followed by loss of sight.The condition is liable to spread to the zygomatic and frontal bones, the vault of the skull, and to the mandible.The base of the skull is not affected.The disease is of slow progress and may become arrested; life may be prolonged for many years, or may be terminated by brain complications or by intercurrent affections.
Bence-Jones|In the disease known as  multiple myeloma , the interior of the ribs, sternum, and bodies of the vertebra is occupied by a reddish gelatinous pulp, the structure of which resembles sarcoma; the bones are reduced to a mere shell, and may break on the slightest pressure; the urine contains albumose, a substance resembling albumen but coagulating at a comparatively low temperature (140° F.), and the coagulum is re-dissolved on boiling, and it is readily precipitated by hydrochloric acid (Bence-Jones).Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.In course of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance; it is at first devoid of lime salts, but later becomes calcified, so that the bones regain their rigidity.This formation of new bone is much in excess of the normal, the bones become large and bulky, their surfaces rough and uneven, their texture sclerosed in parts, and the medullary canal is frequently obliterated.The coexistence of diffuse myelomatosis of the skeleton and albumosuria (Bence-Jones) is referred to on p. 474.Myeloma occurs in the jaws, taking origin in the marrow or from the periosteum of the alveolar process, and is described elsewhere.Sarcoma  and  endothelioma  are the commonest tumours of bone, and present wide variations in structure and in clinical features.Structurally, two main groups may be differentiated: (1) the soft, rapidly growing cellular tumours, and (2) those containing fully formed fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.(1) The  soft cellular tumours  are composed mainly of spindle or round cells; they grow from the marrow of the spongy ends or from the periosteum of the long bones, the diploë of the skull, the pelvis, vertebra, and jaws.As they grow they may cause little alteration in the contour of the bone, but they eat away its framework and replace it, so that the continuity of the bone is maintained only by tumour tissue, and pathological fracture is a frequent result.
Skiagraphy|"Skiagraphy is also of assistance in recognising the vessel involved.Tumours of the thyreoid, enlarged lymph glands, and fatty and sarcomatous tumours can usually be distinguished from aneurysm by the history of the swelling and by physical examination.Cystic tumours and abscesses in the neck are sometimes more difficult to differentiate on account of the apparently expansile character of the pulsation transmitted to them.The fact that compression of the vessel does not affect the size and tension of these fluid swellings is useful in distinguishing them from aneurysm.Treatment.Digital compression of the vessel against the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra the ""carotid tubercle"" has been successfully employed in the treatment of aneurysm near the bifurcation.Skiagraphy is not only of assistance in differentiating new growths from other diseases of bone, but may also yield information as to the situation and nature of the tumour, which may have important bearings on its treatment by operation.When fracture of a long bone takes place in an adolescent or young adult from comparatively slight violence, disease of the bone should be suspected and an X-ray examination made.In difficult cases the final appeal is to exploratory incision and microscopical examination of a portion of the tumour; this should be done when the major operation has been arranged for, the surgeon waiting until the examination is completed.The  prognosis  varies widely.In general, it may be said that periosteal tumours are less favourable than central ones, because they are more liable to give rise to metastases.Permanent cures are unfortunately the exception."
Metastatic Tumours|Metastatic Tumours.Excepting certain cancers which give rise to metastases by lymphatic permeation (Handley), the common metastases arising in the bone-marrow reach their destination through the blood-stream.Secondary cancer is a comparatively common disease, and, as in metastases in other tissues, the secondary growths resemble the parent tumour.The soft forms grow rapidly, and eat away the bone, without altering its shape or form.In slowly growing forms there may be considerable formation of imperfectly formed bone, often deficient in lime salts; this condition may be widely diffused throughout the skeleton, and, as it is associated with softening and bending of the bones, it is known as  cancerous osteomalacia .Secondary cancer of bone is attended with pain, or it suddenly attracts notice by the occurrence of pathological fracture as, for example, in the shaft of the femur or humerus.
Direct Extension from Soft Parts|Cancer of Bone resulting from Direct Extension from Soft Parts.In this group there are also two clinical types.The first is met with in relation to  epithelioma of a mucous surface  for example, the palate, tongue, gums, antrum, frontal sinus, auditory meatus, or middle ear.They will be described under these special regions.The second type is met with in relation to  epithelioma occurring in a sinus , the sequel of suppurative osteomyelitis, compound fracture, or tuberculous disease.The patient has usually had a discharging sinus for a great number of years: we have known it to last as many as fifty.
Cysts of Bone|"Cysts of Bone.With the exception of hydatid cysts, cysts in the interior of bone are the result of the liquefaction of solid tissue; this may be that of chondroma, myeloma, or sarcoma, but more commonly of the marrow in osteomyelitis fibrosa.CHAPTER XXI DISEASES OF JOINTS

Anatomy and Physiology INJURIES OF LYMPH VESSELS  Wounds of     thoracic duct  DISEASES OF LYMPH VESSELS Lymphangitis:      Varieties  Lymphangiectasis Filarial     disease Lymphangioma DISEASES OF LYMPH     GLANDS Lymphadenitis:  Septic ;  Tuberculous ;      Syphilitic  Lymphadenoma Leucocythamia TUMOURS.Surgical Anatomy and Physiology.Lymph is essentially blood plasma, which has passed through the walls of capillaries.After bathing and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct.These lymph vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood vessels  perivascular lymph vessels .They have a structure similar to that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves.Tuberculous Lymphangitis.Although lymph vessels play an important rôle in the spread of tuberculosis, the clinical recognition of the disease in them is exceptional.The infection spreads upwards along the superficial lymphatics, which become nodularly thickened; at one or more points, larger, peri-lymphangitic nodules may form and break down into abscesses and ulcers; the nearest group of glands become infected at an early stage.When the disease is widely distributed throughout the lymphatics of the limb, it becomes swollen and hard a condition illustrated by lupus elephantiasis.Syphilitic lymphangitis  is observed in cases of primary syphilis, in which the vessels of the dorsum of the penis can be felt as indurated cords.In addition to acting as channels for the conveyance of bacterial infection,  lymph vessels frequently convey the cells of malignant tumours , and especially cancer, from the seat of the primary disease to the nearest lymph glands, and they may themselves become the seat of cancerous growth forming nodular cords.Tuberculous Disease of Glands.This is a disease of great frequency and importance.The tubercle bacilli usually gain access to the gland through the afferent lymph vessels, which convey them from some lesion of the surface within the area drained by them.Tuberculous infection may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic septic irritation.While any of the glands in the body may be affected, the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.The appearance of the glands on section  varies with the stage of the disease.Tuberculous infection may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic septic irritation.While any of the glands in the body may be affected, the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.The appearance of the glands on section  varies with the stage of the disease.In the early stages the gland is enlarged, it may be to many times its natural size, is normal in appearance and consistence, and as there is no peri-adenitis it is easily shelled out from its surroundings.On microscopical examination, however, there is evidence of infection in the shape of bacilli and of characteristic giant and epithelioid cells.At a later stage, the gland tissue is studded with minute yellow foci which tend to enlarge and in time to become confluent, so that the whole gland is ultimately converted into a caseous mass.Tuberculous disease in the cervical glands  is a common accompaniment or sequel of adenoids, enlarged tonsils, carious teeth, pharyngitis, middle-ear disease, and conjunctivitis.These lesions afford the bacilli a chance of entry into the lymph vessels, in which they are carried to the glands, where they give rise to disease.The enlargement may affect only one gland, usually below the angle of the mandible, and remain confined to it, the gland reaching the size of a hazel-nut, and being ovoid, firm, and painless.More commonly the disease affects several glands, on one or on both sides of the neck.When the disease commences in the pre-auricular or submaxillary glands, it tends to spread to those along the carotid sheath: when the posterior auricular and occipital glands are first involved, the spread is to those along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid.In many cases all the chains in front of, beneath, and behind this muscle are involved, the enlarged glands extending from the mastoid to the clavicle.Tuberculous disease in the axillary glands  may be a result of extension from those in the neck, from the mamma, ribs, or sternum, or more rarely from the upper extremity.We have seen it from an infected wound of a finger.In some cases no source of infection is discoverable.The individual glands attain a considerable size, and they fuse together to form a large tumour which fills up the axillary space.The disease progresses more rapidly than it does in the cervical glands, and almost always goes on to suppuration with the formation of sinuses.Conservative measures need not be considered, as the only satisfactory treatment is excision, and that without delay.Tuberculous disease in the glands of the groin  is comparatively rare.We have chiefly observed it in the femoral glands as a result of inoculation tubercle on the toes or sole of the foot.The affected glands nearly always break down and suppurate, and after destroying the overlying skin give rise to fungating ulcers.The treatment consists in excising the glands and the affected skin.The dissection may be attended with troublesome hamorrhage from the numerous veins that converge towards the femoral trunk.Tuberculous disease in the  mesenteric  and  bronchial glands  is described with the surgery of regions.Tuberculous disease in the  mesenteric  and  bronchial glands  is described with the surgery of regions.Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Enlargement of lymph glands is a prominent feature of acquired syphilis, especially in the form of the indolent or bullet-bubo which accompanies the primary lesion, and the general enlargement of glands that occurs in secondary syphilis.Gummatous disease in glands is extremely rare; the affected gland rapidly enlarges to the size of a walnut, and may then persist for a long period without further change; if it breaks down, the overlying skin is destroyed and the caseated tissue of the gumma exposed.Lymphadenoma.Hodgkin's Disease  (Pseudo-leukamia of German authors).Tuberculous Lupus.This is an extremely chronic affection of the skin.It rarely extends to the lymph glands, and of all tuberculous lesions is the least dangerous to life.The commonest form of lupus  lupus vulgaris  usually commences in childhood or youth, and is most often met with on the nose or cheek.The early and typical appearance is that of brownish-yellow or pink nodules in the skin, about the size of hemp seed.Healing frequently occurs in the centre of the affected area while the disease continues to extend at the margin.Tuberculous onychia  is met with in children and adolescents.It appears as a livid or red swelling at the root of the nail and spreading around its margins.The epidermis, which is thin and shiny, gives way, and the nail is usually shed.Syphilitic  affections of the nails assume various aspects.A primary chancre at the edge of the nail may be mistaken for a whitlow, especially if it is attended with much pain.Other forms of onychia occur during secondary syphilis simultaneously with the skin eruptions, and may prove obstinate and lead to shedding of the nails.Tuberculous disease  in muscle, while usually due to extension from adjacent tissues, is sometimes the result of a primary infection through the blood-stream.Tuberculous nodules are found disseminated throughout the muscle; the surrounding tissues are indurated, and central caseation may take place and lead to abscess formation and sinuses.We have observed this form of tuberculous disease in the gastrocnemius and in the psoas in the latter muscle apart from tuberculous disease in the vertebra.Tendinitis.German authors describe an inflammation of tendon as distinguished from inflammation of its sheath, and give it the name tendinitis.It is met with most frequently in the tendo-calcaneus in gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon, especially during cold and damp weather.Tuberculous nodules are found disseminated throughout the muscle; the surrounding tissues are indurated, and central caseation may take

tendo-calcaneus in gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon, especially during cold and damp weather.There is localised pain which is aggravated by walking, and the tendon is sensitive and swollen from a little above its insertion to its junction with the muscle.Tuberculous Disease of Tendon Sheaths.This is a comparatively common affection, and is analogous to tuberculous disease of the synovial membrane of joints.It may originate in the sheath, or may spread to it from an adjacent bone.The commonest form hydrops is that in which the synovial sheath is distended with a viscous fluid, and the fibrinous material on the free surface becomes detached and is moulded into melon-seed bodies by the movement of the tendon.The sheath itself is thickened by the growth of tuberculous granulation tissue.The bodies are smooth and of a dull-white colour, and vary greatly in size and shape.CHAPTER XIX THE BURSA

Anatomy Normal and adventitious bursa Injuries: Bursal     hamatoma DISEASES: Infective bursitis; Traumatic or trade     bursitis; Bursal hydrops; Solid bursal tumour; Gonorrhœal and     suppurative forms of bursitis; Tuberculous and syphilitic     disease Tumours  Diseases of individual bursa in the upper and     lower extremities .A bursa is a closed sac lined by endothelium and containing synovia.Some are normally present for instance, that between the skin and the patella, and that between the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus and the great trochanter.Adventitious bursa  are developed as a result of abnormal pressure for example, over the tarsal bones in cases of club-foot.Injuries of Bursa.As a result of contusion, especially in bleeders, hamorrhage may occur into the cavity of a bursa and give rise to a  bursal hamatoma .Tuberculous disease  of bursa closely resembles that of tendon sheaths.It may occur as an independent affection, or may be associated with disease in an adjacent bone or joint.It is met with chiefly in the prepatellar and subdeltoid bursa, or in one of the bursa over the great trochanter.The clinical features are those of an indolent hydrops, with or without melon-seed bodies, or of uniform thickening of the wall of the bursa; the tuberculous granulation tissue may break down into a cold abscess, and give rise to sinuses.The best treatment is to excise the affected bursa, or, when this is impracticable, to lay it freely open, remove the tuberculous tissue with the sharp spoon or knife, and treat the cavity by the open method.Syphilitic disease  is rarely recognised except in the form of bursal and peri-bursal gummata in front of the knee-joint.DISEASES OF BONE Definition of terms Pyogenic diseases:      Acute osteomyelitis and periostitis ;  Chronic and relapsing     osteomyelitis ;  Abscess of bone  Tuberculous disease Syphilitic     disease Hydatids; Rickets; Osteomalacia Ostitis deformans of     Paget Osteomyelitis fibrosa Affections of bones in diseases of     the nervous system Fragilitas ossium Tumours and cysts of bone.Surgical Anatomy.During the period of growth, a long bone such as the tibia consists of a shaft or  diaphysis , and two extremities or  epiphyses .So long as growth continues there intervenes between the shaft and each of the epiphyses a disc of actively growing cartilage  the epiphysial cartilage ; and at the junction of this cartilage with the shaft is a zone of young, vascular, spongy bone known as the  metaphysis  or  epiphysial junction .The shaft is a cylinder of compact bone enclosing the medullary canal, which is filled with yellow marrow.The extremities, which include the ossifying junctions, consist of spongy bone, the spaces of which are filled with red marrow.Tuberculous disease in bone is characterised by its insidious onset and slow progress, and by the frequency with which it is associated with disease of the adjacent joint.Periosteal tuberculosis  is met with in the ribs, sternum, vertebral column, skull, and less frequently in the long bones of the limbs.It may originate in the periosteum, or may spread thence from the marrow, or from synovial membrane.In superficial bones , such as the sternum, the formation of tuberculous granulation tissue in the deeper layer of the periosteum, and its subsequent caseation and liquefaction, is attended by the insidious development of a doughy swelling, which is not as a rule painful, although tender on pressure.While the swelling often remains quiescent for some time, it tends to increase in size, to become boggy or fluctuating, and to assume the characters of a cold abscess.The pus perforates the fibrous layer of the periosteum, invading and infecting the overlying soft parts, its spread being influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues.Tuberculous Osteomyelitis.Tuberculous lesions in the marrow occur as isolated or as multiple foci of granulation tissue, which replace the marrow and erode the trabecula of bone in the vicinity (Fig.124).The individual focus varies in size from a pea to a walnut.The changes that ensue resemble in character those in other tissues, and the extent of the destruction varies according to the way in which the tubercle bacillus and the marrow interact upon one another.The granulation tissue may undergo caseation and liquefaction, or may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue ""encysted tubercle.""Tuberculous lesions in the marrow occur as isolated or as multiple foci of granulation tissue, which replace the marrow and erode the trabecula of bone in the vicinity (Fig.124).The individual focus varies in size from a pea to a walnut.The changes that ensue resemble in character those in other tissues, and the extent of the destruction varies according to the way in which the tubercle bacillus and the marrow interact upon one another.The granulation tissue may undergo caseation and liquefaction, or may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue ""encysted tubercle.""Sometimes the tuberculous granulation tissue spreads in the marrow, assuming the characters of a diffuse infiltration diffuse tuberculous osteomyelitis.Diffuse Tuberculous Osteomyelitis in the shaft of a long bone  is comparatively rare, and has been observed chiefly in the tibia and the ulna in children (Fig.126).It commences at the growing extremity of the diaphysis, and spreads along the medulla to a variable extent; it is attended by the formation of vascular and porous bone on the surface, which causes thickening of the diaphysis; this is most marked at the ossifying junction and tapers off along the shaft.The infection not only spreads along the medulla, but it invades the spongy bone surrounding this, and then the cortical bone, and is only prevented from reaching the soft parts by the new bone formed by the periosteum.The bone is replaced by granulation tissue, and disappears, or part of it may become sclerosed and in time form a sequestrum.In the macerated specimen, the sequestrum appears small in proportion to the large cavity in which it lies.Tuberculous dactylitis  is the name applied to a diffuse form of the disease as it affects the phalanges, metacarpal or metatarsal bones.The lesion presents, on a small scale, all the anatomical changes that have been described as occurring in the medulla of the tibia or ulna, and they are easily followed in skiagrams.A periosteal type of dactylitis is also met with.The  clinical features  are those of a spindle-shaped swelling of a finger or toe, indolent, painless, and interfering but little with the function of the digit.Recovery may eventually occur without suppuration, but it is common to have the formation of a cold abscess, which bursts and forms one or more sinuses.It may be difficult to differentiate tuberculous dactylitis from the enlargement of the phalanges in inherited syphilis (syphilitic dactylitis), especially when the tuberculous lesion occurs in a child who is the subject of inherited syphilis.DISEASES: Errors of     development Bacterial diseases:  Pyogenic ;  Gonorrhœal ;      Tuberculous ;  Syphilitic ;  Acute rheumatism  Diseases     associated with certain constitutional conditions:  Gout ;  Chronic     articular rheumatism ;  Arthritis deformans ;      Hamophilia  Diseases associated with affections of the nervous     system:  Neuro-arthropathies ;  Charcot's disease  Hysterical or     mimetic affections of joints Tumours and cysts Loose bodies.Definition of Terms.The term  synovitis  is applied to any reaction which affects the synovial membrane of a joint.It is usually associated with effusion of fluid, and this may be serous, sero-fibrinous, or purulent.As the term synovitis merely refers to the tissue involved, it should always be used with an adjective such as gouty, gonorrhœal, or tuberculous which indicates its pathological nature.The terms  hydrops ,  hydrarthrosis , and  chronic serous synovitis  are synonymous, and are employed when a serous effusion into the joint is the prominent clinical feature.TUBERCULOUS DISEASE Tuberculous disease of joints results from bacillary infection through the arteries.The disease may commence in the synovial membrane or in the marrow of one of the adjacent bones, and the relative frequency of these two seats of infection has been the subject of considerable difference of opinion.The traditional view of König is that in the knee and most of the larger joints the disease arises in the bone and in the synovial membrane in about equal proportion, and that in the hip the number of cases beginning in the bones is about five times greater than that originating in the membrane.This estimate, so far as the actual frequency of bone lesions is concerned, has been generally accepted, but recent observers, notably John Fraser, do not accept the presence of bone lesions as necessarily proving that the disease commenced in the bones; he maintains, and we think with good grounds, that in many cases the disease having commenced in the synovial membrane, slowly spreads to the bone by way of the blood vessels and lymphatics, and gives rise to lesions in the marrow.Morbid Anatomy.Tuberculous disease in the articular end of a long bone may give rise to  reactive changes  in the adjacent joint, characterised by effusion and by the extension of the synovial membrane over the articular surfaces.Tuberculous disease in the articular end of a long bone may give rise to  reactive changes  in the adjacent joint, characterised by effusion and by the extension of the synovial membrane over the articular surfaces.This may result in the formation of adhesions which obliterate the cavity of the joint or divide it into compartments.These lesions are comparatively common, and are not necessarily due to actual tuberculous infection of the joint.The  infection of the joint  by tubercle originating in the adjacent bone may take place at the periphery, the osseous focus reaching the surface of the bone at the site of reflection of the synovial membrane, and the infection which begins at this point then spreads to the rest of the membrane.Or it may take place in the central area, by the projection of tuberculous granulation tissue into the joint following upon erosion of the cartilage (Fig.156).The Contents of Tuberculous Joints.In a large proportion of cases of synovial tuberculosis the joint is entirely filled up by the diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane.In a small number there is an abundant serous exudate, and with this there may be a considerable formation of fibrin, covering the surface of the membrane and floating in the fluid as flakes or masses; under the influence of movement it may assume the shape of melon-seed bodies.More rarely the joint contains pus, and the surface of the synovial membrane resembles the wall of a cold abscess.Ulceration and Necrosis of Cartilage.The synovial tissue covering the cartilage causes pitting and perforation of the cartilage and makes its way through it, and often spreads widely between it and the subjacent bone; the cartilage may be detached in portions of considerable size.Tuberculous infiltration of the marrow in the surface cancelli breaks up the spongy framework of the bone into minute irregular fragments, so that it disintegrates or crumbles away caries.When there is an absence of caseation and suppuration, the condition is called  caries sicca .The pressure of the articular surfaces against one another favours the progress of ulceration of cartilage and of articular caries.These processes are usually more advanced in the areas most exposed to pressure for example, in the hip-joint, on the superior aspect of the head of the femur, and on the posterior and upper segment of the acetabulum.The occurrence of  pathological dislocation  is due to softening and stretching of the ligaments which normally retain the bones in position, and to some factor causing displacement, which may be the accumulation of fluid or of granulations in the joint, the involuntary contraction of muscles, or some movement or twist of the limb.The occurrence of dislocation is also favoured by destructive changes in the bones.X-ray Appearances of Tuberculous Joints.Gross lesions such as caseous foci in the marrow of the adjacent bone show as clear areas with an ill-defined margin; a sclerosed focus gives a denser shadow than the surrounding bone, and a sequestrum presents a dark shadow of irregular contour, and a clear interval between it and the surrounding bone.Caries of the articular surface imparts a woolly appearance or irregular contour in place of the well-defined outline of the articular end of the bone.In bony ankylosis the shadow of the two bones is a continuous one, the joint interval having been filled up.The minor changes are best appreciated on comparison with the normal joint of the other limb.Wasting of muscles  is a constant accompaniment of tuberculous joint disease.Tuberculous infection of the lymph glands of the limb is exceptional, but may follow upon infection of the skin around the orifice of a sinus.A slight rise of temperature in the evening may be induced in quiescent joint lesions by injury or by movement of the joint under anasthesia, or by the fatigue of a railway journey.When sinuses have formed and become infected with pyogenic bacteria, there may be a diurnal variation in the temperature of the type known as hectic fever (Fig.11).Relative Frequency of Tuberculous Disease in Different Joints.Hospital statistics show that joints are affected in the following order of frequency: Spine, knee, hip, ankle and tarsus, elbow, wrist, shoulder.Relative Frequency of Tuberculous Disease in Different Joints.Hospital statistics show that joints are affected in the following order of frequency: Spine, knee, hip, ankle and tarsus, elbow, wrist, shoulder.The hip and spine are most often affected in childhood and youth, the shoulder and wrist in adults; the knee, ankle, and elbow show little age preference.Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease.The above description applies to tuberculous joint disease in general; it must be modified to include special manifestations or varieties.When the main incidence of the infection affects the synovial membrane, the clinical picture may assume the form of a  hydrops , or of an  empyema  in which the joint is filled with pus.Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease.The above description applies to tuberculous joint disease in general; it must be modified to include special manifestations or varieties.When the main incidence of the infection affects the synovial membrane, the clinical picture may assume the form of a  hydrops , or of an  empyema  in which the joint is filled with pus.More common than either of these is the well-known  white swelling  or  tumor albus  (Wiseman, 1676) which is the clinical manifestation of diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane along with mucoid degeneration of the peri-synovial cellular tissue.It is well seen in joints which are superficial such as the knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist.The swelling, which is the first and most prominent clinical feature, develops gradually and painlessly, obliterating the bony prominences by filling up the natural hollows.Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease on the General Health.Experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint disease are compatible with the appearance of good health.As a rule, however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers, the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be some loss of weight.Treatment.In addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis, local measures are employed.These may be described under two heads the conservative and the operative."
Syphilitic|"Syphilitic ulcers may be met with in any part of the body, but are most frequent in the upper part of the leg (Fig.17), especially around the knee-joint in women, and over the ribs and sternum.On healing, they usually leave a depressed and adherent cicatrix.The  scorbutic ulcer  occurs in patients suffering from scurvy, and is characterised by its prominent granulations, which show a marked tendency to bleed, with the formation of clots, which dry and form a spongy crust on the surface.In  gouty  patients small ulcers which are exceedingly irritable and painful are liable to occur.Ulcers associated with Malignant Disease.Syphilitic lesions are liable to be mistaken for actinomycosis, all the more that in both diseases improvement follows the administration of iodides.When it affects the lower jaw, in its early stages, actinomycosis may closely simulate a periosteal sarcoma.The recognition of the fungus is the crucial point in diagnosis.Prognosis.Spontaneous cure rarely occurs.When the disease implicates internal organs, it is almost always fatal.Gummatous Infiltration of the Skin  (""Syphilitic Lupus"").This is a lesion, met with chiefly on the face and in the region of the external genitals, in which the skin becomes infiltrated with granulation tissue so that it is thickened, raised above the surface, and of a brownish-red colour.It appears as isolated nodules, which may fuse together; the epidermis becomes scaly and is shed, giving rise to superficial ulcers which are usually covered by crusted discharge.The disease tends to spread, creeping over the skin with a serpiginous, crescentic, or horse-shoe margin, while the central portion may heal and leave a scar.From the fact of its healing in the centre while it spreads at the margin, it may resemble tuberculous disease of the skin.It can usually be differentiated by observing that the infiltration is on a larger scale; the progress is much more rapid, involving in the course of months an area which in the case of tuberculosis would require as many years; the scars are sounder and are less liable to break down again; and the disease rapidly yields to anti-syphilitic treatment.Syphilitic.The inflammation associated with syphilis results in thickening of the tunica intima, whereby the lumen of the vessel becomes narrowed, or even obliterated  endarteritis obliterans .The middle coat usually escapes, but the tunica externa is generally thickened.These changes cause serious interference with the nutrition of the parts supplied by the affected arteries.In large trunks, by diminishing the elasticity of the vessel wall, they are liable to lead to the formation of aneurysm.Changes in the arterial walls closely resembling those of syphilitic arteritis are sometimes met with in  tuberculous  lesions.CHAPTER XV THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS

Anatomy and Physiology INJURIES OF LYMPH VESSELS  Wounds of     thoracic duct  DISEASES OF LYMPH VESSELS Lymphangitis:      Varieties  Lymphangiectasis Filarial     disease Lymphangioma DISEASES OF LYMPH     GLANDS Lymphadenitis:  Septic ;  Tuberculous ;      Syphilitic  Lymphadenoma Leucocythamia TUMOURS.Surgical Anatomy and Physiology.Lymph is essentially blood plasma, which has passed through the walls of capillaries.After bathing and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct.These lymph vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood vessels  perivascular lymph vessels .They have a structure similar to that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves.Syphilitic lymphangitis  is observed in cases of primary syphilis, in which the vessels of the dorsum of the penis can be felt as indurated cords.In addition to acting as channels for the conveyance of bacterial infection,  lymph vessels frequently convey the cells of malignant tumours , and especially cancer, from the seat of the primary disease to the nearest lymph glands, and they may themselves become the seat of cancerous growth forming nodular cords.The permeation of cancer by way of the lymphatics, described by Sampson Handley, has already been referred to.Lymphangiectasis  is a dilated or varicose condition of lymph vessels.It is met with as a congenital affection in the tongue and lips, or it may be acquired as the result of any condition which is attended with extensive obliteration or blocking of the main lymph trunks.An interesting type of lymphangiectasis is that which results from the presence of the  filaria Bancrofti  in the vessels, and is observed chiefly in the groin, spermatic cord, and scrotum of persons who have lived in the tropics.Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Enlargement of lymph glands is a prominent feature of acquired syphilis, especially in the form of the indolent or bullet-bubo which accompanies the primary lesion, and the general enlargement of glands that occurs in secondary syphilis.Gummatous disease in glands is extremely rare; the affected gland rapidly enlarges to the size of a walnut, and may then persist for a long period without further change; if it breaks down, the overlying skin is destroyed and the caseated tissue of the gumma exposed.Lymphadenoma.Hodgkin's Disease  (Pseudo-leukamia of German authors).This is a rare disease, the origin of which is as yet unknown, but analogy would suggest that it is due to infection with a slowly growing micro-organism.Syphilitic lesions progress more rapidly, and also lack the characteristic margin.The differentiation from squamous epithelioma is of considerable importance, as the latter affection spreads more rapidly, involves the lymph glands early, and is much more dangerous to life.Treatment.In rodent cancers of limited size say less than one inch in diameter free excision is the most rapid and certain method of treatment.The alternative is the application of radium or of the Röntgen rays, which, although requiring many exposures, results in cure with the minimum of disfigurement.If the cancer already covers an extensive area, or has invaded the cavity of the orbit or nose, radium or X-rays yield the best results.Syphilitic  affections of the nails assume various aspects.A primary chancre at the edge of the nail may be mistaken for a whitlow, especially if it is attended with much pain.Other forms of onychia occur during secondary syphilis simultaneously with the skin eruptions, and may prove obstinate and lead to shedding of the nails.They also occur in inherited syphilis.In addition to general treatment, an ointment containing 5 per cent.of oleate of mercury should be applied locally.Syphilitic contracture  is a condition which has been observed chiefly in the later secondary period; the biceps of the arm and the hamstrings in the thigh are the muscles more commonly affected.The striking feature is a gradually increasing difficulty of extending the limb at the elbow or knee, and progressive flexion of the joint.The affected muscle is larger and firmer than normal, and its electric excitability is diminished.In tertiary syphilis, individual muscles may become the seat of interstitial myositis or of gummata, and these affections readily yield to anti-syphilitic remedies.Tuberculous disease  in muscle, while usually due to extension from adjacent tissues, is sometimes the result of a primary infection through the blood-stream.Tuberculous nodules are found disseminated throughout the muscle; the surrounding tissues are indurated, and central caseation may take place and lead to abscess formation and sinuses.Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths.These closely resemble the syphilitic affections of the synovial membrane of joints.During the secondary period the lesion usually consists in effusion into the sheath; gummata are met with during the tertiary period.Arborescent lipoma has been found in the sheaths of tendons about the wrist and ankle, sometimes in a multiple and symmetrical form, unattended by symptoms and disappearing under anti-syphilitic treatment.Tumours of Tendon Sheaths.Innocent tumours, such as  lipoma ,  fibroma , and  myxoma , are rare.Syphilitic disease  is rarely recognised except in the form of bursal and peri-bursal gummata in front of the knee-joint.New growths  include the fibroma, the myxoma, the myeloma or giant-celled tumour, and various forms of sarcoma.Diseases of Individual Bursa.The  olecranon bursa  is frequently the seat of pyogenic infection and of traumatic or trade bursitis, the latter being known as ""miner's"" or ""student's elbow.""The  sub-deltoid  or  sub-acromial bursa , which usually presents a single cavity and does not normally communicate with the shoulder-joint, is indispensable in abduction and rotation of the humerus.When the arm is abducted, the fixed lower part or floor of the bursa is carried under the acromion, and the upper part or roof is rolled up in the same direction, hence tenderness over the inflamed bursa may disappear when the arm is abducted (Dawbarn's sign).DISEASES OF BONE Definition of terms Pyogenic diseases:      Acute osteomyelitis and periostitis ;  Chronic and relapsing     osteomyelitis ;  Abscess of bone  Tuberculous disease Syphilitic     disease Hydatids; Rickets; Osteomalacia Ostitis deformans of     Paget Osteomyelitis fibrosa Affections of bones in diseases of     the nervous system Fragilitas ossium Tumours and cysts of bone.Surgical Anatomy.During the period of growth, a long bone such as the tibia consists of a shaft or  diaphysis , and two extremities or  epiphyses .So long as growth continues there intervenes between the shaft and each of the epiphyses a disc of actively growing cartilage  the epiphysial cartilage ; and at the junction of this cartilage with the shaft is a zone of young, vascular, spongy bone known as the  metaphysis  or  epiphysial junction .The shaft is a cylinder of compact bone enclosing the medullary canal, which is filled with yellow marrow.The extremities, which include the ossifying junctions, consist of spongy bone, the spaces of which are filled with red marrow.SYPHILITIC DISEASE Syphilitic affections of bone may be met with at any period of the disease, but the graver forms occur in the tertiary stage of acquired and inherited syphilis.The virus is carried by the blood-stream to all parts of the skeleton, but the local development of the disease appears to be influenced by a predisposition on the part of individual bones.Syphilitic diseases of bone are much less common in practice than those due to pyogenic and tuberculous infectious, and they show a marked predilection for the tibia, sternum, and skull.They differ from tuberculous affections in the frequency with which they attack the shafts of bones rather than the articular ends, and in the comparative rarity of joint complications.Evanescent periostitis  is met with in acquired syphilis during the period of the early skin eruptions.The patient complains, especially at night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibia, or ulna.Syphilitic diseases of bone are much less common in practice than those due to pyogenic and tuberculous infectious, and they show a marked predilection for the tibia, sternum, and skull.They differ from tuberculous affections in the frequency with which they attack the shafts of bones rather than the articular ends, and in the comparative rarity of joint complications.Evanescent periostitis  is met with in acquired syphilis during the period of the early skin eruptions.The patient complains, especially at night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibia, or ulna.Localised tenderness is elicited on pressure, and there is slight swelling, which, however, rarely amounts to what may be described as a  periosteal node .In the later stages of acquired syphilis,  gummatous periostitis and osteomyelitis  occur, and are characterised by the formation in the periosteum and marrow of circumscribed gummata or of a diffuse gummatous infiltration.Syphilitic sequestra are heavier and denser than normal bone, because sclerosis usually precedes death of the bone.The bones especially affected by gummatous disease are: the skull, the septum of the nose, the nasal bones, palate, sternum, femur, tibia, and the bones of the forearm.In the bones of the skull , gummata may form in the peri-cranium, diploë, or dura mater.An isolated gumma forms a firm elastic swelling, shading off into the surroundings.In the macerated bone there is a depression or an actual perforation of the calvaria; multiple gummata tend to fuse with one another at their margins, giving the appearance of a combination of circles: these sometimes surround an area of bone and cut it off from its blood supply (Fig.130).Syphilitic disease of the tibia  may be taken as the type of the affection as it occurs  in the long bones .Gummatous disease in the periosteum may be localised and result in the formation of a well-defined node, or the whole shaft may become the seat of an irregular nodular enlargement (Fig.132).If the bone is macerated, it is found to be heavier and bulkier than normal; there is diffuse sclerosis with obliteration of the medullary canal, and the surface is uneven from heaping up of new bone hyperostosis (Fig.131).If a periosteal gumma breaks down and invades the skin, a syphilitic ulcer is formed with carious bone at the bottom.Epiphysitis or Syphilitic Perichondritis.The first of these terms is misleading, because the lesion involves the ossifying junction and the shaft of the bone, and the epiphysis only indirectly.The young bone is replaced by granulation tissue, so that large clear areas are seen with the X-rays.The symptoms are referred to the joint, because it is there that the muscles are inserted and drag on the perichondrium when movement occurs; swelling is most marked in the vicinity of the joint, and it may be added to by effusion into the synovial cavity.The baby, usually under six months, is noticed to be feverish and fretful and to cry when touched.The mother discovers that the pain is caused by moving a particular limb, usually the arm, as the humerus, radius, and ulna are the bones most commonly affected; the limb, moreover, hangs useless at the side as if paralysed, and the condition was formerly described as  syphilitic pseudo-paralysis .Syphilitic dactylitis  is met with chiefly in children.It may affect any of the fingers or toes, but is commonest in the first phalanx of the index-finger or of the thumb.Several fingers may be attacked at the same time or in succession.The lesion consists in a gummatous infiltration of the soft parts surrounding the phalanx, or a gummatous osteomyelitis, but there is practically no tendency to break down and discharge, or to the formation of a sequestrum as is so common in tuberculous dactylitis.The finger becomes the seat of a swelling, which is more evident on the dorsal aspect, and, according to the distribution and extent of the disease, it is acorn-shaped, fusiform, or cylindrical.It is firm and elastic, and usually painless.DISEASES: Errors of     development Bacterial diseases:  Pyogenic ;

 Charcot's disease  Hysterical or     mimetic affections of joints Tumours and cysts Loose bodies.Definition of Terms.The term  synovitis  is applied to any reaction which affects the synovial membrane of a joint.It is usually associated with effusion of fluid, and this may be serous, sero-fibrinous, or purulent.As the term synovitis merely refers to the tissue involved, it should always be used with an adjective such as gouty, gonorrhœal, or tuberculous which indicates its pathological nature.The terms  hydrops ,  hydrarthrosis , and  chronic serous synovitis  are synonymous, and are employed when a serous effusion into the joint is the prominent clinical feature.SYPHILITIC DISEASE Syphilitic affections of joints are comparatively rare.As in tuberculosis, the disease may be first located in the synovial membrane, or it may spread to the joint from one of the bones.In  acquired syphilis , at an early stage and before the skin eruptions appear, one of the large joints, such as the shoulder or knee, may be the seat of pain  arthralgia  which is worse at night.In the secondary stage, a  synovitis  with serous effusion is not uncommon, and may affect several joints.Syphilitic  hydrops  is met with almost exclusively in the knee; it is frequently bilateral, and is insidious in its onset and progress, the patient usually being able to go about.In the  tertiary stage  the joint lesions are persistent and destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or periosteum.Syphilitic  hydrops  is met with almost exclusively in the knee; it is frequently bilateral, and is insidious in its onset and progress, the patient usually being able to go about.In the  tertiary stage  the joint lesions are persistent and destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or periosteum.Peri-synovial  and  peri-bursal gummata  are met with in relation to the knee-joint of middle-aged adults, especially women.They are usually multiple, develop slowly, and are rarely sensitive or painful.One or more of the gummata may break down and give rise to tertiary ulcers.The co-existence of indolent swellings, ulcers, and depressed scars in the vicinity of the knee is characteristic of tertiary syphilis.Syphilitic osteo-arthritis  results from a gumma in the periosteum or marrow of one of the adjacent bones.There is gradual enlargement of one of the bones, the patient complains of pains, which are worst at night.The disease may extend to the synovial membrane and be attended with effusion into the joint, or it may erupt on the periosteal surface and invade the skin, forming one or more sinuses.The further progress is complicated by the occurrence of pyogenic infection leading to necrosis of bone, in the knee-joint, for example, the patella or one of the condyles of the femur or tibia, may furnish a sequestrum.In such cases, anti-syphilitic treatment must be supplemented by operation for the removal of the diseased tissues.In the knee, excision is rarely necessary; but in the elbow it may be called for to obtain a movable joint."
Conditions of Impaired Mobility of Joints|Conditions of Impaired Mobility of Joints.There are four conditions of impaired mobility in joints: rigidity, contracture, ankylosis, and locking.Rigidity  is the fixation of a joint by involuntary contraction of muscles, and is of value as a sign of disease in deep-seated joints, such as the hip.It disappears under anasthesia.Contracture  is the term applied when the fixation is due to permanent shortening of the soft parts around a joint muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, or skin.As the structures on the flexor aspect are more liable to undergo such shortening, contracture is nearly always associated with flexion.
Contracture|"DISEASES OF MUSCLE AND OF TENDONS:  Atrophy ;  ""Muscular     rheumatism""   Fibrositis ;  Contracture ;  Myositis ;      Calcification and Ossification ;  Tumours .DISEASES OF TENDON     SHEATHS:  Teno-synovitis .INJURIES  Contusion of Muscle.Contusion of muscle, which consists in bruising of its fibres and blood vessels, may be due to violence acting from without, as in a blow, a kick, or a fall; or from within, as by the displacement of bone in a fracture or dislocation.The symptoms are those common to all contusions, and the patient complains of severe pain on attempting to use the muscle, and maintains an attitude which relaxes it.If the sheath of the muscle also is torn, there is subcutaneous ecchymosis, and the accumulation of blood may result in the formation of a hamatoma.Contracture of Muscles.Permanent shortening of muscles results from the prolonged approximation of their points of attachment, or from structural changes in their substance produced by injury or by disease.It is a frequent accompaniment and sometimes a cause of deformities, in the treatment of which lengthening of the shortened muscles or their tendons may be an essential step.Myositis.Ischamic Myositis.Volkmann was the first to describe a form of myositis followed by contracture, resulting from interference with the arterial blood supply.Contracture  is the term applied when the fixation is due to permanent shortening of the soft parts around a joint muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, or skin.As the structures on the flexor aspect are more liable to undergo such shortening, contracture is nearly always associated with flexion.Contracture may result from disease of the joint, or from conditions outside it for example, disease in one of the adjacent bones, or lesions of the nerves.Ankylosis  is the term applied when impaired mobility results from changes involving the articular surfaces.It is frequently combined with contracture.Three anatomical varieties of ankylosis are recognised (a) The  fibrous , in which there are adhesions between the opposing surfaces, which may be in the form of loose isolated bands of fibrous tissue, or may bind the bones so closely together as to obliterate the cavity of the joint.Contracture may result from disease of the joint, or from conditions outside it for example, disease in one of the adjacent bones, or lesions of the nerves.Ankylosis  is the term applied when impaired mobility results from changes involving the articular surfaces.It is frequently combined with contracture.Three anatomical varieties of ankylosis are recognised (a) The  fibrous , in which there are adhesions between the opposing surfaces, which may be in the form of loose isolated bands of fibrous tissue, or may bind the bones so closely together as to obliterate the cavity of the joint.The resulting stiffness, therefore, varies from a mere restriction of the normal range of movement, up to a close union of the bones which prevents movement.Fibrous ankylosis may follow upon injury, especially dislocation or fracture implicating a joint, or it may result from any form of arthritis."
skiagraphy|The nature and extent of ankylosis may be learned by skiagraphy; in osseous ankylosis the shadow of the two bones is a continuous one.In fibrous as contrasted with osseous ankylosis mobility may be elicited, although only to a limited extent; while in osseous ankylosis the joint is rigidly fixed, and attempts to move it are painless.The  treatment  is influenced by the nature of the original lesion, the variety of the ankylosis, and the attitude of the joint.When there is restriction of movement due to fibrous adhesions, these may be elongated or ruptured.Elongation of the adhesions may be effected by manipulations, exercises, and the use of special forms of apparatus such as the application of weights to the limb.It may be necessary to administer an anasthetic before rupturing strong fibrous adhesions, and this procedure must be carried out with caution, in view of such risks as fracture of the bone which is often rarefied or separation of an epiphysis.
Arthroplasty|Arthroplasty.Murphy of Chicago devised this operation for restoring movement to an ankylosed joint.It consists in transplanting between the bones a flap of fat-bearing tissue, from which a bursal cavity lined with endothelium and containing a fluid rich in mucin is ultimately formed.Arthroplasty is most successful in ankylosis following upon injury; when the ankylosis results from some infective condition such as tuberculosis or gonorrhœa, it is liable to result in failure either because of a fresh outbreak of the infection or because the ankylosis recurs.When arthroplasty is impracticable, and a movable joint is desired for example at the elbow a considerable amount of bone, and it may be also of periosteum and capsular ligament, is resected to allow of the formation of a false joint.When bony ankylosis has occurred with the joint in an undesirable attitude for example flexion at the hip or knee it can sometimes be remedied by osteotomy or by a wedge-shaped resection of the bone, with or without such additional division of the contracted soft parts as will permit of the limb being placed in the attitude desired.Arthroplasty is most successful in ankylosis following upon injury; when the ankylosis results from some infective condition such as tuberculosis or gonorrhœa, it is liable to result in failure either because of a fresh outbreak of the infection or because the ankylosis recurs.When arthroplasty is impracticable, and a movable joint is desired for example at the elbow a considerable amount of bone, and it may be also of periosteum and capsular ligament, is resected to allow of the formation of a false joint.When bony ankylosis has occurred with the joint in an undesirable attitude for example flexion at the hip or knee it can sometimes be remedied by osteotomy or by a wedge-shaped resection of the bone, with or without such additional division of the contracted soft parts as will permit of the limb being placed in the attitude desired.Bony ankylosis of the joints of a finger, whether the result of injury or disease, is difficult to remedy by any operative procedure, for while it is possible to restore mobility, the new joint is apt to be flail-like.Locking.A joint is said to lock when its movements are abruptly arrested by the coming together of bony outgrowths around the joint.
Extremities|The deformities at the knee (genu valgum, genu varum, and genu recurvatum), and at the hip (coxa vara), will be described in the volume dealing with the Extremities.The majority of cases seen in surgical practice suffer from the deformities resulting from rickets rather than from the active disease.The examination of a large series of children at different ages shows that the deformities become less and less frequent with each year.Those who recover may ultimately show no trace of rickets, and this is especially true of children who grow at the average rate; in those, however, in whom growth is retarded, especially from the fifth to the seventh year, the deformities are apt to be permanent.It may be noted that the scoliosis due to rickets has little tendency towards recovery.Treatment.The more important of these are described along with the surgery of the Extremities.DISEASES OF JOINTS  Bacterial Diseases.In most bacterial diseases the organisms are carried to the joint in the blood-stream, and they lodge either in the synovial membrane or in one of the bones, whence the disease subsequently spreads to the other structures of the joint.Organisms may also be introduced through accidental wounds.It has been shown experimentally that joints are among the most susceptible parts of the body to infection, and this would appear to be due to the viscid character of the synovial fluid, which protects organisms from bactericidal agents in the tissues and fluids.PYOGENIC DISEASES The commoner pyogenic diseases are the result of infection of one or other of the joint structures with  staphylococci  or  streptococci , which may be demonstrated in the exudate in the joint and in the substance of the synovial membrane.The secondary changes in joints which are the seat of paralytic contracture are considered with the surgery of the Extremities.In cases of  hysteria  and other  functional affections of the nervous system , an intermittent neuropathic hydrops has been observed especially in the knee.Without apparent cause, the joint fills with fluid and its movements become restricted, and after from two to eight days the swelling subsides and the joint returns to normal.A remarkable feature of the condition is that the effusion into the joint recurs at regular intervals, it may be over a period of years.Psychic conditions have been known to induce attacks, and sometimes to abort them or even to cause their disappearance.Hence it has been recommended that treatment by suggestion should be employed along with tonic doses of quinine and arsenic.
the pus perforates the joint capsule|If the pus perforates the joint capsule, there are signs of abscess or of diffuse suppuration in the cellular tissue.The final disorganisation of the joint is indicated by abnormal mobility and grating of the articular surfaces, or by spontaneous displacement of the bones, and this may amount to dislocation.In the acute arthritis of infants, the epiphysis concerned may be separated and displaced.When the  joint is infected through an external wound , the anatomical features are similar to those observed when the infection has reached the joint by the blood-stream, but the destructive changes tend to be more severe and are more likely to result in disorganisation.The  terminations  vary with the gravity of the infection and with the stage at which treatment is instituted.In the milder forms recovery is the rule, with more or less complete restoration of function.
Pneumococcal|Pneumococcal affections of joints , the result of infection with the pneumococcus of Fraenkel, are being met with in increasing numbers.The local lesion varies from a  synovitis  with infiltration of the synovial membrane and effusion of serum or pus, to an  acute arthritis  with erosion of cartilage, caries of the articular surfaces, and disorganisation of the joint.The knee is most frequently affected, but several joints may suffer at the same time.In most cases the joint affection makes its appearance a few days after the commencement of a pneumonia, but in a number of instances, especially among children, the lung is not specially involved, and the condition is an indication of a generalised pneumococcal infection, which may manifest itself by endocarditis, empyema, meningitis, or peritonitis, and frequently has a fatal termination.The differential diagnosis from other forms of pyogenic infection is established by bacteriological examination of the fluid withdrawn from the joint.The treatment is carried out on the same lines as in other pyogenic infections, considerable reliance being placed on the use of autogenous vaccines.
diplococcus|"The joint lesions which accompany  acute rheumatism  or ""rheumatic fever"" are believed to be due to a diplococcus.In the course of a general illness in which there is moderate pyrexia and profuse sweating, some of the larger joints, and not infrequently the smaller ones also, become swollen and extremely sensitive, so that the sufferer lies in bed helpless, dreading the slightest movement.From day to day fresh joints are attacked, while those first affected subside, often with great rapidity.Affections of the heart-valves and of the pericardium are commonly present.On recovery from the acute illness, it may be found that the joints have entirely recovered, but in a small proportion of cases certain of them remain stiff and pass into the crippled condition described under chronic rheumatism.There is no call for operative interference."
Gonococcal Affections of Joints|Gonococcal Affections of Joints.These include all forms of joint lesion occurring in association with gonorrhœal urethritis, vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhœal ophthalmia.They may develop at any stage of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however, after the discharge has ceased.There is no connection between the severity of the gonorrhœa and the incidence of joint disease.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.
gonorrhœal ophthalmia|These include all forms of joint lesion occurring in association with gonorrhœal urethritis, vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhœal ophthalmia.They may develop at any stage of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however, after the discharge has ceased.There is no connection between the severity of the gonorrhœa and the incidence of joint disease.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.The gonococcus is carried to the joint in the blood-stream and is first deposited in the synovial membrane, in the tissues of which it can usually be found; it may be impossible to find it in the exudate within the joint.
Detoxicated|Detoxicated vaccines should be given from the first, and in afebrile cases the injection of a foreign protein, such as anti-typhoid vaccine, is beneficial (Harrison).Murphy has found benefit from the introduction into the joint, in the early stages, of from 5 to 15 c.c.of a 2 per cent.solution of formalin in glycerin.This may be repeated within a week, the patient being kept in bed with light weight extension.In the chronic hydrops the fluid is withdrawn, and about an ounce of a 1 per cent.
The Contents of Tuberculous Joints|The Contents of Tuberculous Joints.In a large proportion of cases of synovial tuberculosis the joint is entirely filled up by the diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane.In a small number there is an abundant serous exudate, and with this there may be a considerable formation of fibrin, covering the surface of the membrane and floating in the fluid as flakes or masses; under the influence of movement it may assume the shape of melon-seed bodies.More rarely the joint contains pus, and the surface of the synovial membrane resembles the wall of a cold abscess.Ulceration and Necrosis of Cartilage.The synovial tissue covering the cartilage causes pitting and perforation of the cartilage and makes its way through it, and often spreads widely between it and the subjacent bone; the cartilage may be detached in portions of considerable size.
Terminations|Terminations of Contusions.The usual termination is a complete return to the normal, some of the extravasated blood being organised, but most of it being reabsorbed.During the process characteristic alterations in the colour of the effused blood take place as a result of changes in the blood pigment.In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours the margins of the blue area become of a violet hue, and as time goes on the discoloured area increases in size, and becomes successively green, yellow, and lemon-coloured at its margins, the central part being the last to change.The rate at which this play of colours proceeds is so variable, and depends on so many circumstances, that no time-limits can be laid down.During the disintegration of the effused blood the adjacent lymph glands may become enlarged, and on dissection may be found to be pigmented.Terminations and Sequela.A natural process of cure may occur at any stage, the tuberculous tissue being replaced by scar tissue.Recovery is apt to be attended with impairment of movement due to adhesions, ankylosis, or contracture of the peri-articular structures.Caseous foci in the interior of the bones may become encapsulated, and a cure be thus effected, or they may be the cause of a relapse of the disease at a later date.Interference with growth is comparatively common, and may involve only the epiphysial junctions in the immediate vicinity of the joint affected, or those of all the bones of the limb.This is well seen in adults who have suffered from severe disease of the hip in childhood the entire limb, including the foot, being shorter and smaller than the corresponding parts of the opposite side.
Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease|Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease.The above description applies to tuberculous joint disease in general; it must be modified to include special manifestations or varieties.When the main incidence of the infection affects the synovial membrane, the clinical picture may assume the form of a  hydrops , or of an  empyema  in which the joint is filled with pus.More common than either of these is the well-known  white swelling  or  tumor albus  (Wiseman, 1676) which is the clinical manifestation of diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane along with mucoid degeneration of the peri-synovial cellular tissue.It is well seen in joints which are superficial such as the knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist.The swelling, which is the first and most prominent clinical feature, develops gradually and painlessly, obliterating the bony prominences by filling up the natural hollows.
Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease|Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease on the General Health.Experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint disease are compatible with the appearance of good health.As a rule, however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers, the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be some loss of weight.Treatment.In addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis, local measures are employed.These may be described under two heads the conservative and the operative.
the General Health|Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease on the General Health.Experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint disease are compatible with the appearance of good health.As a rule, however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers, the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be some loss of weight.Treatment.In addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis, local measures are employed.These may be described under two heads the conservative and the operative.
Immobilisation|Immobilisation may be secured by bandages, splints, extension, or other apparatus.Extension  with weight and pulley is of value in securing rest, especially in disease of the hip or knee; it eliminates muscular spasm, relieves pain and startings at night, and prevents abnormal attitudes of the limb.If, when the patient first comes under observation, the limb is in a deformed attitude which does not readily yield to extension, the deformity should be corrected under an anasthetic.The induction of hyperamia  is often helpful, the rubber bandage or the hot-air chamber being employed for an hour or so morning and evening.Injection of Iodoform.This is carried out on the same lines as have been described for tuberculous abscess.
Operative Treatment|Operative Treatment.In aggravated cases, when the patient is suffering pain, when his occupation is interfered with by repeated attacks of phlebitis, or when there are large pouches on the veins, operative treatment is called for.The younger the patient the clearer is the indication to operate.It may be necessary to operate to enable a patient to enter one of the public services, even although no symptoms are present.The presence of an ulcer does not contra-indicate operation; the ulcer should be excised, and the raw surface covered with skin grafts, before dealing with the veins.The  operation of Trendelenburg  is especially appropriate to cases in which the trunk of the great saphena vein in the thigh is alone involved.Operative Treatment.This consists in the removal of the affected nerve or nerves, either by resection  neurectomy ; or by a combination of resection with twisting or tearing of the nerve from its central connections  avulsion .To prevent the regeneration of the nerve after these operations, the canal of exit through the bone should be obliterated; this is best accomplished by a silver screw-nail driven home by an ordinary screw-driver (Charles H. Mayo).When the neuralgia involves branches of two or of all three trunks, or when it has recurred after temporary relief following resection of individual branches, the  removal of the semilunar ganglion , along with the main trunks of the maxillary and mandibular divisions, should be considered.The operation is a difficult and serious one, but the results are satisfactory so far as the cure of the neuralgia is concerned.There is little or no disability from the unilateral paralysis of the muscles of mastication; but on account of the insensitiveness of the cornea, the eye must be protected from irritation, especially during the first month or two after the operation; this may be done by fixing a large watch-glass around the edge of the orbit with adhesive plaster.Operative Treatment.Other things being equal, operation is more often indicated in adults than in children, because after the age of twenty there is less prospect of recovery under conservative treatment, there is more tendency for the disease to relapse and to invade the internal organs, and there is no fear of interfering with the growth of the bones.The state of the general health may necessitate operation as the most rapid method of removing the disease.The social status of the patient must also be taken into account; the bread-winner, under existing social conditions, may be unable to give up his work for a sufficient time to give conservative measures a fair trial.The  local conditions  which decide for or against operation are differently regarded by different surgeons, but it may be said in general terms that operative interference is indicated in cases in which the disease continues to progress in spite of a fair trial of conservative measures; in cases unsuited for conservative treatment that is to say, where there are severe bone lesions.Operative interference is indicated also when the functional result will be better than that likely to be obtained by conservative measures, as is often the case in the knee and elbow.
SYPHILITIC|SYPHILITIC DISEASE Syphilitic affections of bone may be met with at any period of the disease, but the graver forms occur in the tertiary stage of acquired and inherited syphilis.The virus is carried by the blood-stream to all parts of the skeleton, but the local development of the disease appears to be influenced by a predisposition on the part of individual bones.Syphilitic diseases of bone are much less common in practice than those due to pyogenic and tuberculous infectious, and they show a marked predilection for the tibia, sternum, and skull.They differ from tuberculous affections in the frequency with which they attack the shafts of bones rather than the articular ends, and in the comparative rarity of joint complications.Evanescent periostitis  is met with in acquired syphilis during the period of the early skin eruptions.The patient complains, especially at night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibia, or ulna.SYPHILITIC DISEASE Syphilitic affections of joints are comparatively rare.As in tuberculosis, the disease may be first located in the synovial membrane, or it may spread to the joint from one of the bones.In  acquired syphilis , at an early stage and before the skin eruptions appear, one of the large joints, such as the shoulder or knee, may be the seat of pain  arthralgia  which is worse at night.In the secondary stage, a  synovitis  with serous effusion is not uncommon, and may affect several joints.Syphilitic  hydrops  is met with almost exclusively in the knee; it is frequently bilateral, and is insidious in its onset and progress, the patient usually being able to go about.In the  tertiary stage  the joint lesions are persistent and destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or periosteum.
the formation of gummata|In the  tertiary stage  the joint lesions are persistent and destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or periosteum.Peri-synovial  and  peri-bursal gummata  are met with in relation to the knee-joint of middle-aged adults, especially women.They are usually multiple, develop slowly, and are rarely sensitive or painful.One or more of the gummata may break down and give rise to tertiary ulcers.The co-existence of indolent swellings, ulcers, and depressed scars in the vicinity of the knee is characteristic of tertiary syphilis.The disease spreads throughout the capsule and synovial membrane, which becomes diffusely thickened and infiltrated with granulation tissue which eats into and replaces the articular cartilage.

Rheumatoid Arthritis|"Arthritis Deformans  ( Osteo-arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Rheumatic Gout, Malum Senile, Traumatic or Mechanical Arthritis ).Under the term arthritis deformans, which was first employed by Virchow, it is convenient to include a number of joint affections which have many anatomical and clinical features in common.The disease is widely distributed in the animal kingdom, both in domestic species and in wild animals in the natural state such as the larger carnivora and the gorilla; evidence of it has also been found in the bones of animals buried with prehistoric man.The morbid changes in the joints present a remarkable combination of atrophy and degeneration on the one hand and overgrowth on the other, indicating a profound disturbance of nutrition in the joint structures.The nature of this disturbance and its etiology are imperfectly known.By many writers it is believed to depend upon some form of auto-intoxication, the toxins being absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, and those who suffer are supposed to possess what has been called an ""arthritic diathesis."""
gonorrhœal|"It would appear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue, causing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small superficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhœal urethritis, the cicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the formation of stricture.When mucous glands are present in the membrane, the pus is mixed with mucus  muco-pus .DIFFUSE CELLULITIS AND DIFFUSE SUPPURATION Cellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some organism commonly the  streptococcus pyogenes  into the cellular connective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon sheaths, or other structures.Infection always takes place through a breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail, and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation becomes manifest.The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the lymphatics.The virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in which they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which they are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.A  gonorrhœal  form of myositis is sometimes met with; it is painful, but rarely goes on to suppuration.In the early secondary period of  syphilis , the muscles may be the seat of dull, aching, nocturnal pains, especially in the neck and back.Syphilitic contracture  is a condition which has been observed chiefly in the later secondary period; the biceps of the arm and the hamstrings in the thigh are the muscles more commonly affected.The striking feature is a gradually increasing difficulty of extending the limb at the elbow or knee, and progressive flexion of the joint.The affected muscle is larger and firmer than normal, and its electric excitability is diminished.In tertiary syphilis, individual muscles may become the seat of interstitial myositis or of gummata, and these affections readily yield to anti-syphilitic remedies.The toxic or infective agent is conveyed to the tendon sheaths through the blood-stream, as in the gouty, gonorrhœal, and tuberculous varieties, or is introduced directly through a wound, as in the common pyogenic form of teno-synovitis.Teno-synovitis Crepitans.In the simple or traumatic form of teno-synovitis, although the most prominent etiological factor is a strain or over-use of the tendon, there would appear to be some other, probably a toxic, factor in its production, otherwise the affection would be much more common than it is: only a small proportion of those who strain or over-use their tendons become the subjects of teno-synovitis.The opposed surfaces of the tendon and its sheath are covered with fibrinous lymph, so that there is friction when they move on one another.The  clinical features  are pain on movement, tenderness on pressure over the affected tendon, and a sensation of crepitation or friction when the tendon is moved in its sheath.The crepitation may be soft like the friction of snow, or may resemble the creaking of new leather ""saddle-back creaking.""This condition may alternate with a gonorrhœal affection of one of the larger joints.It may subside under rest and soothing applications, but is liable to relapse.In the more severe variety the skin is red, and the swelling partakes of the characters of a phlegmon with threatening suppuration; it may result in crippling from adhesions.Even if pus forms in the sheath, the tendon rarely sloughs.The treatment consists in inducing hyperamia by Bier's method; and a vaccine may be employed with satisfactory results.Tuberculous Disease of Tendon Sheaths.Other Diseases of Bursa  are associated with  gonorrhœal infection , and with  rheumatism , especially that following scarlet fever, and are apt to be persistent or to relapse after apparent cure.In the  gouty  form, urate of soda is deposited in the wall of the bursa, and may result in the formation of chalky tumours, sometimes of considerable size (Fig.114).Tuberculous disease  of bursa closely resembles that of tendon sheaths.It may occur as an independent affection, or may be associated with disease in an adjacent bone or joint.It is met with chiefly in the prepatellar and subdeltoid bursa, or in one of the bursa over the great trochanter.As the term synovitis merely refers to the tissue involved, it should always be used with an adjective such as gouty, gonorrhœal, or tuberculous which indicates its pathological nature.The terms  hydrops ,  hydrarthrosis , and  chronic serous synovitis  are synonymous, and are employed when a serous effusion into the joint is the prominent clinical feature.Hydrops may occur apart from disease for example, in the knee-joint from repeated sprains, or when there is a loose body in the joint but is met with chiefly in the chronic forms of synovitis which result from gonorrhœa, tuberculosis, syphilis, arthritis deformans, or arthropathies of nerve origin.Arthritis  is the term applied when not only the synovial membrane but the articular surfaces, and it may be also the ends of the bones, are involved, and it is necessary to prefix a qualifying adjective which indicates its nature.When effusion is present, it may be serous, as in arthritis deformans, or sero-fibrinous or purulent, as in certain forms of pyogenic and tuberculous arthritis.Wasting of the muscles, especially the extensors, in the vicinity of the joint is a constant accompaniment of arthritis.These include all forms of joint lesion occurring in association with gonorrhœal urethritis, vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhœal ophthalmia.They may develop at any stage of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however, after the discharge has ceased.There is no connection between the severity of the gonorrhœa and the incidence of joint disease.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.The gonococcus is carried to the joint in the blood-stream and is first deposited in the synovial membrane, in the tissues of which it can usually be found; it may be impossible to find it in the exudate within the joint.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.The gonococcus is carried to the joint in the blood-stream and is first deposited in the synovial membrane, in the tissues of which it can usually be found; it may be impossible to find it in the exudate within the joint.The joint lesions may be the only evidence of metastasis, or they may be part of a general infection involving the endocardium, pleura, and tendon sheaths.The joints most frequently affected are the knee, elbow, ankle, wrist, and fingers.Usually two or more joints are affected.(1) A  dry poly-arthritis  met with in the joints and tendon sheaths of the wrist and hand, formerly described as gonorrhœal rheumatism, which in some cases is trifling and evanescent, and in others is persistent and progressive, and results in stiffness of the affected joints and permanent crippling of the hand and fingers.(2) The commonest type is a  chronic synovitis  or  hydrops , in which the joint very often the knee becomes filled with a serous or sero-fibrinous exudate.There are no reactive changes in the synovial membrane, cellular tissue, or skin, nor is there any fever or disturbance of health.The movements are free except in so far as they are restricted by the amount of fluid in the joint.It usually subsides in two or three weeks under rest, but tends to relapse.(3) An  acute synovitis  with peri-articular phlegmon is most often met with in the elbow, but it occurs also in the knee and ankle.The chief points in the differential diagnosis from acute articular rheumatism are, that the gonorrhœal affection is more often confined to one or two joints, has little tendency to wander from joint to joint, and its progress is not appreciably influenced by salicylates, although these drugs may relieve pain.The conclusive point is the recognition of a gonorrhœal discharge or of threads in the urine.The disease may persist or may relapse, and the patient may be laid up for weeks or months, and may finally be crippled in one or in several joints.The  treatment  besides that of the urethral disease or of the ophthalmia consists in rest until all pain and sensitiveness have disappeared.The pain is relieved by salicylates, but most benefit follows weight extension, the induction of hyperamia by the rubber bandage and hot-air baths; if the joint is greatly distended, the fluid may be withdrawn by a needle and syringe.Detoxicated vaccines should be given from the first, and in afebrile cases the injection of a foreign protein, such as anti-typhoid vaccine, is beneficial (Harrison).The conclusive point is the recognition of a gonorrhœal discharge or of threads in the urine.The disease may persist or may relapse, and the patient may be laid up for weeks or months, and may finally be crippled in one or in several joints.The  treatment  besides that of the urethral disease or of the ophthalmia consists in rest until all pain and sensitiveness have disappeared.The pain is relieved by salicylates, but most benefit follows weight extension, the induction of hyperamia by the rubber bandage and hot-air baths;

with further use of the joint, the bone is worn away, so that in a ball-and-socket joint like the hip, the head of the femur and the acetabulum are markedly altered in size and shape.It is to be diagnosed from the other forms of hydrops already considered the purely traumatic, the pyogenic, gonorrhœal, tuberculous, and syphilitic and from that associated with Charcot's disease.Hypertrophied fringes and pedunculated or loose bodies  often co-exist with hydrops, and give rise to characteristic clinical features, particularly in the knee.The fringes, especially when they assume the type of the arborescent lipoma, project into the cavity of the joint, filling up its recesses and distending its capsule so that the joint is swollen and slightly flexed.Pain is not a prominent feature, and the patient may walk fairly well.On grasping the joint while it is being actively flexed and extended, the fringes may be felt moving under the fingers.Symptoms from impaction of a loose body are exceptional."
Hypertrophied|Hypertrophied Scars.Scars occasionally broaden out and become prominent, and on exposed parts this may prove a source of disappointment after operations such as those for goitre or tuberculous glands in the neck.There is sometimes considerable improvement from exposure to the X-rays.Keloid.This term is applied to an overgrowth of scar tissue which extends beyond the area of the original wound, and the name is derived from the fact that this extension occurs in the form of radiating processes, suggesting the claws of a crab.It is essentially a fibroma or new growth of fibrous tissue, which commences in relation to the walls of the smaller blood vessels; the bundles of fibrous tissue are for the most part parallel with the surface, and the epidermis is tightly stretched over them.Hypertrophied fringes and pedunculated or loose bodies  often co-exist with hydrops, and give rise to characteristic clinical features, particularly in the knee.The fringes, especially when they assume the type of the arborescent lipoma, project into the cavity of the joint, filling up its recesses and distending its capsule so that the joint is swollen and slightly flexed.Pain is not a prominent feature, and the patient may walk fairly well.On grasping the joint while it is being actively flexed and extended, the fringes may be felt moving under the fingers.Symptoms from impaction of a loose body are exceptional.The dry form of arthritis deformans , although specially common in the knee, is met with in other joints, either as a mon-articular or poly-articular disease; and it is also met with in the joints of the spine and of the fingers as well as in the temporo-mandibular joint.
nd of tonics|Benefit is also derived from the administration of cod-liver oil, and of tonics, such as strychnin, arsenic, and iron, and in some cases of iodide of potassium.Luff recommends the administration over long periods of guaiacol carbonate, in cachets beginning with doses of 5–10 grs.and increased to 15–20 grs.thrice daily.A course of treatment at one of the reputed spas Aix, Bath, Buxton, Gastein, Harrogate, Strathpeffer, Wiesbaden, Wildbad is often beneficial.In some cases benefit has followed the prolonged internal administration of liquid paraffin.
thrice daily|The skin of the affected area should be painted with iodine, and a Klapp's suction bell applied thrice daily.If pus forms, the skin is frozen with ethyl-chloride and a small incision made, after which the application of the suction bell is persevered with.The further treatment consists in the use of diluted boracic or resin ointment.In multiple boils on the trunk and limbs, lysol or boracic baths are of service; the underclothing should be frequently changed, and that which is discarded must be disinfected.In patients with recurrence of boils about the neck, re-infection frequently takes place from the scalp, to which therefore treatment should be directed.Any impaired condition of health should be corrected; when, there is sugar or albumen in the urine the conditions on which these depend must receive appropriate treatment.thrice daily.A course of treatment at one of the reputed spas Aix, Bath, Buxton, Gastein, Harrogate, Strathpeffer, Wiesbaden, Wildbad is often beneficial.In some cases benefit has followed the prolonged internal administration of liquid paraffin.On the assumption that the condition is the result of an auto-intoxication from the intestinal tract, saline purges and irrigation of the colon are indicated, and Arbuthnot Lane claims to have brought about improvement by short-circuiting or by resecting the colon.Residence in a warm and dry climate, with an open-air life, has been known to arrest the disease when other measures have failed to give relief.The application of radium and the ingestion of radio-active waters have also been recommended.

anasthesia|"The patient is given a general anasthetic, or regional anasthesia is obtained by injections of a solution of one per cent.novocain into the line of the lateral and middle cutaneous nerves; the disinfection of the skin is carried out on the usual lines, any chemical agent being finally got rid of, however, by means of alcohol followed by saline solution.The strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly transferred to the surface, for which they should be made to form a complete carpet, slightly overlapping the edges of the area and of one another; some blunt instrument is used to straighten out the strips, which are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express blood and air-bells and to ensure accurate contact, for this must be as close as that between a postage stamp and the paper to which it is affixed.As a dressing for the grafted area and of that also from which the grafts have been taken, gauze soaked in  liquid paraffin  the patent variety known as  ambrine  is excellent appears to be the best; the gauze should be moistened every other day or so with fresh paraffin, so that, at the end of a week, when the grafts should have united, the gauze can be removed without risk of detaching them.Dental wax  is another useful type of dressing; as is also  picric acid  solution.Over the gauze, there is applied a thick layer of cotton wool, and the whole dressing is kept in place by a firmly applied bandage, and in the case of the limbs some form of splint should be added to prevent movement.To allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anasthesia, to cut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the infected area, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely.If only a small opening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations.Subcutaneous Whitlow.In this variety the infection manifests itself as a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (Fig.9, c), which sometimes spreads towards the palm of the hand.The finger becomes red, swollen, and tense; there is severe throbbing pain, which is usually worst at night and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure.If pus forms, small incisions are made, under local anasthesia, to relieve the tension in the sheath and to diminish the risk of the tendons sloughing.No form of drain should be inserted.In the fingers the incisions should be made in the middle line, and in the palm they should be made over the metacarpal bones to avoid the digital vessels and nerves.If pus has spread under the transverse carpal ligament, the incision must be made above the wrist.Passive movements and massage must be commenced as early as possible and be perseveringly employed to diminish the formation of adhesions and resulting stiffness.Subperiosteal Whitlow.Trivial injuries may be the starting-point, the anasthesia produced by the ergotin preventing the patient taking notice of them.Alcoholism is a potent predisposing cause.As it is impossible to predict how far the process will spread, it is advisable to wait for the formation of a line of demarcation before operating, and then to amputate immediately above the dead part.BACTERIAL VARIETIES OF GANGRENE The acute bacillary forms of gangrene all assume the moist type from the first, and, spreading rapidly, result in extensive necrosis of tissue, and often end fatally.The infection is usually a mixed one in which anaërobic bacteria predominate.The anaërobe most constantly present is the  bacillus arogenes capsulatus , usually in association with other anaërobes, and sometimes with pyogenic diplo- and streptococci.If the cyst re-forms, it should be removed by open dissection under local anasthesia.Puncture with a tenotomy knife and scraping the interior, and the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory, methods of treatment.Ganglia  in the substance of  tendons  are rare.The diagnosis rests on the observation that the small tumour is cystic, and that it follows the movements of the tendon.The cyst is at first multiple, but the partitions disappear, and the spaces are thrown into one.The tendon is so weakened that it readily ruptures.It is to be borne in mind that a state of general anasthesia does not prevent injurious impulses reaching the brain and causing shock during an operation.If the main nerves of the part are ""blocked"" by injection of a local anasthetic, however, the central nervous system is protected from these impulses.While the aged frequently manifest but few signs of shock, they have a correspondingly feeble power of recovery; and while many young children suffer little, even after severe operations, others with much less cause succumb to shock.When the injured person's mind is absorbed with other matters than his own condition, as, for example, during the heat of a battle or in the excitement of a railway accident or a conflagration, even severe injuries may be unattended by pain or shock at the time, although when the period of excitement is over, the severity of the shock is all the greater.The same thing is observed in persons injured while under the influence of alcohol.Clinical Features.To prevent after-pain in abdominal wounds he recommends injecting the edges with quinine and urea hydrochlorate before suturing, the resulting anasthesia lasting for twenty-four to forty-eight hours.To these preventive measures the term  anoci-association  has been applied.In selecting an anasthetic, it may be borne in mind that chloroform lowers the blood pressure more than ether does, and that with spinal anasthesia there is no lowering of the blood pressure.Treatment.A patient suffering from shock should be placed in the recumbent position, with the foot of the bed raised to facilitate the return circulation in the large veins, and so to increase the flow of blood to the brain.His bed should be placed near a large fire, and the patient himself surrounded by cotton wool and blankets and hot-bottles.In selecting an anasthetic, it may be borne in mind that chloroform lowers the blood pressure more than ether does, and that with spinal anasthesia there is no lowering of the blood pressure.Treatment.A patient suffering from shock should be placed in the recumbent position, with the foot of the bed raised to facilitate the return circulation in the large veins, and so to increase the flow of blood to the brain.His bed should be placed near a large fire, and the patient himself surrounded by cotton wool and blankets and hot-bottles.If he has lost much blood, the limbs should be wrapped in cotton wool and firmly bandaged from below upwards, to conserve as much of the circulating blood as possible in the trunk and head.If the shock is moderate in degree, as soon as the patient has been put to bed, about a pint of saline solution should be introduced into the rectum, and 10 to 15 minims of adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000) may with advantage be added to the fluid.Gangrene  may ensue if the blood supply is seriously interfered with, or the signs of  ischamia  may develop; the muscles lose their elasticity, become hard and paralysed, and anasthesia of the ""glove"" or ""stocking"" type, with other alterations of sensation ensue.Apart from ischamia,  reflex paralysis  of motion and sensation of a transient kind may follow injury of a large vessel.Treatment  is carried out on the same lines as for similar injuries due to other causes.INJURIES OF VEINS Veins are subject to the same forms of injury as arteries, and the results are alike in both, such variations as occur being dependent partly on the difference in their anatomical structure, and partly on the conditions of the circulation through them.Subcutaneous rupture  of veins occur most frequently in association with fractures and in the reduction of dislocations.The veins most commonly ruptured are the popliteal, the axillary, the femoral, and the subclavian.After division of a nerve containing sensory fibres, there is an area of absolute cutaneous insensibility to touch (anasthesia), to pain (analgesia), and to all degrees of temperature  loss of protopathic sensibility ; surrounded by an area in which there is loss of sensation to light touch, inability to recognise minor differences of temperature (72°–104° F.), and to appreciate as separate impressions the contact of the two points of a compass  loss of epicritic sensibility  (Head and Sherren) (Figs.91, 92).Motor Phenomena.There is immediate and complete loss of voluntary power in the muscles supplied by the divided nerve.The muscles rapidly waste, and within from three to five days, they cease to react to the faradic current.When tested with the galvanic current, it is found that a stronger current must be used to call forth contraction than in a healthy muscle, and the contraction appears first at the closing of the circuit when the anode is used as the testing electrode.A similar form of paralysis is sometimes met with from the pressure of a tourniquet, from tight bandages or splints, from the pressure exerted by a dislocated bone or by excessive callus, and from hyper-extension of the arm during anasthesia.In all these forms there is impaired sensation, rarely amounting to anasthesia, marked muscular wasting, and diminution or loss of voluntary motor power, while and this is a point of great importance the normal electrical reactions are preserved.There may also develop trophic changes such as blisters, superficial ulcers, and clubbing of the tips of the fingers.The prognosis is usually favourable, as recovery is the rule within from one to three months.If, however, neuritis supervenes, the electrical reactions are altered, the muscles degenerate, and recovery may be retarded or may fail to take place.Injuries which act abruptly or instantaneously are illustrated in the crushing of a nerve by the sudden displacement of a sharp-edged fragment of bone, as may occur in comminuted fractures of the humerus.In all these forms there is impaired sensation, rarely amounting to anasthesia, marked muscular wasting, and diminution or loss of voluntary motor power, while and this is a point of great importance the normal electrical reactions are preserved.There may also develop trophic changes such as blisters, superficial ulcers, and clubbing of the tips of the fingers.The prognosis is usually favourable, as recovery is the rule within from one to three months.If, however, neuritis supervenes, the electrical reactions are altered, the muscles degenerate, and recovery may be retarded or may fail to take place.Injuries which act abruptly or instantaneously are illustrated in the crushing of a nerve by the sudden displacement of a sharp-edged fragment of bone, as may occur in comminuted fractures of the humerus.The symptoms include perversion or loss of sensation, motor paralysis, and atrophy of muscles, which show the reaction of degeneration from the eighth day onwards.In the sciatica that results from neuritis and perineuritis, there is marked tenderness on pressure due to the involvement of the nerve filaments in the sheath of the nerve, and there may be patches of cutaneous anasthesia, loss of tendon reflexes, localised wasting of muscles, and vaso-motor and trophic changes.The presence of the reaction of degeneration confirms the diagnosis of neuritis.In long-standing cases the pain and discomfort may lead to a postural scoliosis ( ischias-scoliotica ).Diagnosis.Pain referred along the course of the sciatic nerve on one side, or, as is sometimes the case, on both sides, is a symptom of tumours of the uterus, the rectum, or the pelvic bones.It may result also from the pressure of an abscess or an aneurysm either inside the pelvis or in the buttock, and is sometimes associated with disease of the spinal medulla, such as tabes.The alcohol acts by destroying the nerve fibres, and must be brought into direct contact with them; if the nerve has been properly struck the injection is followed by complete anasthesia in the distribution of the nerve.The relief may last for from six months to three years; if the pain returns, the injection may be repeated.The strength of the alcohol should be 85 per cent., and the amount injected about 2 c.c.; a general, or preferably a local, anasthetic (novocain) should be employed (Schlösser); the needle is 8 cm.long, and 0.7 mm.in diameter.A more radical procedure is to excise, under local anasthesia, the portion of skin containing the corn and the underlying bursa.The majority of so-called corn solvents consist of a solution of salicylic acid in collodion; if this is painted on daily, the epidermis dies and can then be pared away.The unskilful paring of corns may determine the occurrence of senile gangrene in those who are predisposed to it by disease of the arteries.Chilblains.Chilblain or  erythema pernio  is a vascular disturbance resulting from the alternate action of cold and heat on the distal parts of the body.Chilblains are met with chiefly on the fingers and toes in children and anamic girls.Local anasthesia is to be preferred.It is important that none of the cyst wall be left behind.In large and adherent wens an ellipse of skin is removed along with the cyst.When inflamed, it may be impossible to dissect out the cyst, and the wall should be destroyed with carbolic acid, the resulting wound being treated by the open method.Moles.The term mole is applied to a pigmented, and usually hairy, patch of skin, present at or appearing shortly after birth.It disappears under anasthesia.Contracture  is the term applied when the fixation is due to permanent shortening of the soft parts around a joint muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, or skin.As the structures on the flexor aspect are more liable to undergo such shortening, contracture is nearly always associated with flexion.Contracture may result from disease of the joint, or from conditions outside it for example, disease in one of the adjacent bones, or lesions of the nerves.Ankylosis  is the term applied when impaired mobility results from changes involving the articular surfaces.It is frequently combined with contracture.Forcible breaking down of adhesions under anasthesia is not recommended, as it is followed by great suffering and the adhesions re-form.Operation for ankylosis arthroplasty should not be undertaken, as the ankylosis recurs.TUBERCULOUS DISEASE Tuberculous disease of joints results from bacillary infection through the arteries.The disease may commence in the synovial membrane or in the marrow of one of the adjacent bones, and the relative frequency of these two seats of infection has been the subject of considerable difference of opinion.The traditional view of König is that in the knee and most of the larger joints the disease arises in the bone and in the synovial membrane in about equal proportion, and that in the hip the number of cases beginning in the bones is about five times greater than that originating in the membrane.This estimate, so far as the actual frequency of bone lesions is concerned, has been generally accepted, but recent observers, notably John Fraser, do not accept the presence of bone lesions as necessarily proving that the disease commenced in the bones; he maintains, and we think with good grounds, that in many cases the disease having commenced in the synovial membrane, slowly spreads to the bone by way of the blood vessels and lymphatics, and gives rise to lesions in the marrow.This muscular fixation disappears under anasthesia.Abnormal attitudes of the limb  occur earlier, and are more pronounced in cases in which pain and other irritative symptoms of articular disease are well marked, and are best illustrated by the attitudes assumed in disease of the hip.They are due to reflex or involuntary contraction of the muscles acting on the joint, with the object of placing it in the attitude of greatest ease; they also disappear under anasthesia.With the lapse of time they not only become exaggerated, but may become permanent from ankylosis or from contracture of the soft parts round the joint.Startings at night  are to be regarded as an indication that there is progressive disease involving the articular surfaces.The formation of extra-articular abscess  may take place early, or it may not occur till long after the disease has subsided.They are due to reflex or involuntary contraction of the muscles acting on the joint, with the object of placing it in the attitude of greatest ease; they also disappear under anasthesia.With the lapse of time they not only become exaggerated, but may become permanent from ankylosis or from contracture of the soft parts round the joint.Startings at night  are to be regarded as an indication that there is progressive disease involving the articular surfaces.The formation of extra-articular abscess  may take place early, or it may not occur till long after the disease has subsided.The abscess may develop so insidiously that it does not attract attention until it has attained considerable size, especially when associated with disease of the spine, pelvis, or hip.The position of the abscess in relation to different joints is fairly constant and is determined by the anatomical relationships of the capsule and synovial membrane to the surrounding tissues.A slight rise of temperature in the evening may be induced in quiescent joint lesions by injury or by movement of the joint under anasthesia, or by the fatigue of a railway journey.When sinuses have formed and become infected with pyogenic bacteria, there may be a diurnal variation in the temperature of the type known as hectic fever (Fig.11).Relative Frequency of Tuberculous Disease in Different Joints.Hospital statistics show that joints are affected in the following order of frequency: Spine, knee, hip, ankle and tarsus, elbow, wrist, shoulder.The hip and spine are most often affected in childhood and youth, the shoulder and wrist in adults; the knee, ankle, and elbow show little age preference.The use of the Röntgen rays, or examination of the joint under anasthesia, is helpful.The  local treatment  consists chiefly in improving the nutrition of the affected limb by means of massage, exercises, baths, and electricity.Splints are to be avoided.In refractory cases, benefit may follow the application of blisters or of Corrigan's button.The general condition of the patient must be treated on the same lines as in other neuroses.The Weir-Mitchell treatment may have to be employed in obstinate cases, the patient being secluded from her friends and placed in charge of a nurse."
The Weir-Mitchell|The Weir-Mitchell treatment may have to be employed in obstinate cases, the patient being secluded from her friends and placed in charge of a nurse.Complete recovery is the rule, but when the muscles are weak and wasted from prolonged disuse, a considerable time may elapse before the limb returns to normal.TUMOURS AND CYSTS New growths taking origin in the synovial membrane are rare, and are not usually diagnosed before operation.They are attended with exudation into the joint, and in the case of  sarcoma  the fluid is usually blood-stained.If the tumour projects in a polypoidal manner into the joint, it may cause symptoms of loose body.One or two cases have been recorded in which a  cartilaginous tumour  growing from the synovial membrane has erupted through the joint capsule and infiltrated the adjoining muscles.
Organised Connective Tissue|Bodies composed of Organised Connective Tissue.These are comparatively common in joints that are already the seat of some chronic disease, such as arthritis deformans, Charcot's arthropathy, or synovial tuberculosis.They take origin almost exclusively from an erratic overgrowth of the fringes of the synovial membrane, and may consist entirely of fat, the arborescent lipoma (Fig.159) being the most pronounced example of this variety.Fibrous tissue or cartilage may form in one or more of the fatty fringes and give rise to hard nodular masses, which may attain a considerable size, and in course of time may undergo ossification.Like other hypertrophies on a free surface, they tend to become pedunculated, and so acquire a limited range of movement.
Loose Bodies in Joints|Loose Bodies in Joints which are otherwise healthy.It is in joints otherwise healthy that loose bodies causing the classical symptoms and calling for operative treatment are most frequently met with.They occur chiefly in the knee and elbow of healthy males under the age of thirty.The complaint may be of vague pains, of occasional cracking on moving the joint, or of impairment of function usually an inability to extend or flex the joint completely.In many cases a clear account is given of the symptoms which arise when the body is impacted between the articular surfaces, namely, sudden onset of intense sickening pain, loss of power in the limb and locking of the joint, followed by effusion and other accompaniments of a severe sprain.On some particular movement, the body is disengaged, the locking disappears, and recovery takes place.
