Question: How can surgery be defined?
Answer: Surgery can be defined as "the art of treating lesions and malformations of the human body by manual operations, mediate and immediate."
Question: What factors can interfere with the normal process of repair?
Answer: Factors that can interfere with the normal process of repair include infection by disease-producing microorganisms, the presence of foreign substances, undue movement of the affected part, and improper applications and dressings.
Question: What is primary union or healing by first intention?
Answer: Primary union or healing by first intention is the process of healing that occurs in an aseptic wound where its edges are in contact, and there is no loss of tissue, presence of foreign substances, or infection with disease-producing microorganisms.
Question: What is granulation tissue?
Answer: Granulation tissue is an elementary form of new tissue that is produced in the damaged area in response to irritation caused by injury or disease. It consists of young capillary loops, fibroblasts, and other cells and fluids, and plays a crucial role in the repair process.
Question: What is the role of fibroblasts in the formation of cicatricial tissue?
Answer: Fibroblasts play a crucial role in transforming granulation tissue into cicatricial tissue by becoming elongated and spindle-shaped, and producing fine fibrillated material around them. This eventually forms white fibrous tissue, which replaces the granulation tissue.
Question: How does healing of epidermis occur in the wound?
Answer: Healing of the epidermis occurs as the cells of the rete Malpighii near the cut edge begin to sprout onto the wound surface, and by their proliferation, gradually cover the granulations with a thin pellicle. As the epithelium increases in thickness, it assumes a greyish-white color.
Question: What is the process of healing by granulation?
Answer: Healing by granulation is a modification of the reparative process where a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to fill a gap in a wound that cannot be approximated due to loss of tissue or the presence of a drainage tube or gauze packing. The granulation tissue gradually fills the gap and is replaced by cicatricial tissue, while the surface is covered by the ingrowth of epithelium from the edges.
Question: How does healing occur when two granulating surfaces are brought into apposition?
Answer: Healing occurs by the exudate on the granulating surfaces causing them to adhere, followed by the formation of capillary loops passing from one surface to the other, and the final fusion of the surfaces through the development of granulation and cicatricial tissue.
Question: What is healing under a scab?
Answer: Healing under a scab is when a small superficial wound exposed to air forms a hard crust or scab, which serves to protect the surface from external irritation. Under the scab, granulation tissue forms, transforms into cicatricial tissue, and is covered by the growth of epithelium until the scab eventually separates, leaving a scar.
Question: How does the speed of the reparative process in highly vascular parts like the face compare to less vascular areas?
Answer:In highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative process is rapid, and even extensive wounds may be firmly united in from three to five days. In areas with less free anastomosis, the process is more prolonged.
Question: Can epithelium be reproduced from a different type of epithelium?
Answer:Epithelium is usually reproduced from a similar type, although metaplastic transformation of cells from one kind of epithelium into another kind can take place.
Question: What is the primary source of regeneration for articular cartilage after being divided?
Answer:When an articular cartilage is divided, it is repaired by ordinary cicatricial fibrous tissue derived from the proliferating cells of the perichondrium.
Question: How do tendons heal after being divided?
Answer:When a tendon is divided, the gap is filled by a blood clot, which is eventually replaced by granulation tissue. The fibroblasts in this tissue develop into typical tendon cells, forming new tendon fibers.
Question: Can unstriped muscle regenerate to a large extent?
Answer:Unstriped muscle does not seem to be capable of being regenerated to any significant degree.
Question: How does the healing process of stomach and intestine wounds differ from those of hollow viscera like the esophagus and urinary bladder?
Answer:Wounds of the stomach and intestine heal rapidly when the peritoneal surfaces are accurately apposed. In contrast, hollow viscera like the esophagus and urinary bladder, which are not covered by peritoneum, heal less rapidly.
Question: Does the healing process vary between young and old patients?
Answer:Wounds heal slightly more quickly in young patients than in older ones, although the difference is small and can only be demonstrated through careful observations.
Question: Are tissues of the brain or spinal cord in humans capable of regeneration?
Answer:There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in humans ever takes place. Any loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.
Question: What is the meaning of the terms "graft" and "transplant" in the context of tissue transplantation?
Answer: Graft and transplant refer to the portion of tissue transferred from one part of the body to another in order to promote healing and restoration of function.
Question: What is the primary condition for a graft to have a favorable chance of "taking"?
Answer: The transplanted tissue must retain its vitality until it has formed an organic connection with the tissue in which it is placed, allowing it to derive the necessary nourishment from its new bed.
Question: What happens when the conditions for a successful graft are fulfilled?
Answer: The tissues of the graft continue to proliferate, producing new tissue elements to replace those that are lost, making it possible for the graft to become incorporated with the tissue it is in contact with.
Question: What is the capacity of dead tissue in grafting?
Answer: Dead tissue can only act as a model or, at most, as a scaffolding for mobile tissue elements derived from the parent tissue with which the graft is in contact.
Question: What changes occur in a successful graft over time?
Answer: A successful graft not only regenerates but also acquires a system of lymph and blood vessels. In time, it bleeds when cut into and is permeated by new nerve fibers spreading from the periphery towards the center.
Question: What factors influence the suitability of tissues for grafting purposes?
Answer: The period of survival of different tissues of the body after death is associated with their capacity for grafting. Higher tissues, like the central nervous system and highly specialized glandular tissues, lose vitality quickly and are unsuitable for grafting. Connective tissues, such as fat, cartilage, and bone, retain vitality for several hours and can be successfully used for grafting purposes.
Question: What are the three types of grafts based on their sources?
Answer: Autoplastic grafts are derived from the same individual; homoplastic grafts are derived from another animal of the same species; and heteroplastic grafts are derived from an animal of another species.
Question: Which type of graft has the greatest prospects of success?
Answer: Autoplastic grafts have the greatest prospects of success and are therefore preferred whenever possible.
Question: What are the key conditions that permit the primary healing of wounds and the healing of grafts?
Answer: The graft must not be roughly handled, allowed to dry, or subjected to chemical irritation. It must be brought into accurate contact with the new tissue without blood clot intervening, no movement between the two, and all infection must be excluded.
Question: Can tissues be preserved in cold storage for future grafting?
Answer: It is now agreed that tissues separated from the body for some time lose their vitality and are unsuited for grafting purposes. To preserve tissue for future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall until needed.
Question: What is the term used for the transplantation of blood?
Answer: The term used for the transplantation of blood is transfusion.
Question: Which tissue was the first to be used for grafting purposes?
Answer: The skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting purposes.
Question: In which situations is skin grafting of raw surfaces commonly indicated?
Answer: Skin grafting of raw surfaces is commonly indicated after operations for malignant disease in which considerable areas of skin must be sacrificed, and after accidents, such as avulsion of the scalp by machinery.
Question: What are the two methods of skin grafting?
Answer: The two methods of skin grafting are epidermis or epithelial grafting and cutis-grafting.
Question: What is Thiersch's method of epidermis grafting?
Answer: Thiersch's method of epidermis grafting involves transplanting strips of epidermis shaved from the surface of the skin, with the razor passing through the tips of the papillae.
Question: What are the sources of mucous membrane grafts?
Answer: The sources of mucous membrane grafts are limited, but they can be obtained from the lip, cheek, and conjunctiva.
Question: Which tissue is used as a graft to fill defects in the dura mater?
Answer: The fascia lata of the thigh is widely used as a graft to fill defects in the dura mater.
Question: Do muscle and nerve retain their vitality when severed from their surroundings and function as grafts?
Answer: No, muscle and nerve do not retain their vitality when severed from their surroundings and do not function as grafts except for their connective-tissue elements.
Question: What happens to the transplanted ovary or thyreoid in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the abdominal wall?
Answer: In these new surroundings, the ovary or thyreoid is vascularized and has been shown to function, but there is not sufficient regeneration of the essential tissue elements to "carry on"; the secreting tissue is gradually replaced by connective tissue and the special function comes to an end.

Question: What is the title of John Hilton's classical work that emphasizes the importance of rest and pain?
Answer: Rest and Pain
Question: What does "rest" imply in the context of surgical management?
Answer: Rest implies more than physical repose; it also includes preventing physiological and mechanical function as far as possible.
Question: What is a source of interference with repair in wounds?
Answer: Irritation, either by mechanical agents such as rough, unsuitable dressings, bandages, or ill-fitting splints; or by chemical agents in the form of strong lotions or other applications.
Question: How does an unhealthy or devitalised condition of the patient's tissues affect the reparative process?
Answer: It hinders the reparative process, as bruised or lacerated skin heals less kindly than skin cut with a smooth, sharp instrument, and persistent venous congestion prevents the access of healthy blood.
Question: What types of constitutional diseases can impede healing?
Answer: Bright's disease, diabetes, syphilis, scurvy, or alcoholism.
Question: What is the most potent factor in disturbing the natural process of repair in wounds?
Answer: Infection by disease-producing micro-organisms or pathogenic bacteria.
Question: What is the role of applied bacteriology in surgery?
Answer: The role of applied bacteriology in surgery is so important that it dominates every department of surgery, and nearly all surgical questions have to be considered from the standpoint of bacteriology.
Question: How is the term 'sepsis' used in clinical surgery?
Answer: In clinical surgery, the term 'sepsis' is used to denote all conditions in which bacterial infection has taken place, particularly those involving pyogenic bacteria.
Question: What does the term 'aseptic' convey?
Answer: The term 'aseptic' conveys the idea of freedom from all forms of bacteria, putrefactive or otherwise.
Question: How are bacteria classified according to their shape?
Answer: Bacteria are classified into (1) globular cocci, (2) rod-shaped bacilli, and (3) spiral or wavy forms spirilla.
Question: What is a diplococcus?
Answer: A diplococcus is a type of coccus that divides in such a way that the resulting cells remain in pairs, such as the bacteria of gonorrhea and pneumonia.
Question: What are some examples of bacilli?
Answer: Tuberculosis, tetanus, anthrax, and many other surgical diseases are caused by different forms of bacilli.
Question: What is the most important member of the spirilla group?
Answer: The spirochete associated with syphilis is the most important member of the spirilla group.
Question: What are the conditions necessary for bacterial life?
Answer: Bacteria require a suitable food supply, an alkaline medium, moisture, and varying levels of oxygen for growth and development. The most suitable temperature for bacterial life is from 95° to 102° F.
Question: What is the difference between aerobic bacilli, anaerobes, and facultative anaerobes?
Answer: Aerobic bacilli require oxygen for their survival, anaerobes cannot live in the presence of oxygen, and facultative anaerobes prefer oxygen but can live without it.
Question: What factors determine the pathogenic properties of bacteria?
Answer: The pathogenic properties of bacteria depend on certain features peculiar to the invading bacteria and others peculiar to the host.
Question: What are saphrophytes?
Answer: Saphrophytes are bacteria that have the power of living upon dead matter.
Question: What is the term used to describe the power a parasitic micro-organism has to multiply in the body and cause disease?
Answer: The term is "virulence."
Question: How does the virulence of a parasitic micro-organism vary?
Answer: Virulence varies not only with different species but also in the same species at different times and under varying circumstances.
Question: What factors can make a person more susceptible to infection?
Answer: Factors include any lowering of the individual's vitality (locally or generally), bruised or torn tissue, bodily fatigue, exposure to cold and damp, and certain diseases that increase the liability to infection.
Question: What is the role of leucocytes in immunity?
Answer: Leucocytes play an important role in immunity by ingesting bacteria and destroying them through a process of intra-cellular digestion called phagocytosis.
Question: What are opsonins or alexins?
Answer: Opsonins or alexins are certain ferments produced by polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes in the process of destroying bacteria. They act on bacteria by a process comparable to narcotisation, making them an easy prey for phagocytes.
Question: What is the purpose of the serum treatment?
Answer: The serum treatment aims to provide the patient with a sufficiency of antibodies to neutralize the infection.
Question: What is the difference between natural immunity and acquired immunity?
Answer: Natural immunity refers to the insusceptibility of some persons to certain diseases, while acquired immunity refers to the protection a patient gains, at least for some time, from a second attack of an acute disease after having experienced it once.
Question: What is the vaccine treatment developed by A. E. Wright?
Answer: The vaccine treatment developed by A. E. Wright involves injecting specially prepared dead cultures of the causative organisms while the disease is still active. This treatment is based on the fact that these vaccines render the bacteria in the tissues less able to resist the attacks of phagocytes.
Question: When should vaccines not be given?
Answer: Vaccines should not be given while a patient is in a negative phase, as it may reduce the opsonic index and make the vaccines themselves dangerous.
