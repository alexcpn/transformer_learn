4,"What is granulation tissue? Granulation tissue is an elementary form of new tissue that is produced in the damaged area in response to irritation caused by injury or disease. It consists of young capillary loops, fibroblasts, and other cells and fluids, and plays a crucial role in the repair process."
12,"What is the primary source of regeneration for articular cartilage after being divided?When an articular cartilage is divided, it is repaired by ordinary cicatricial fibrous tissue derived from the proliferating cells of the perichondrium."
16,"Does the healing process vary between young and old patients?Wounds heal slightly more quickly in young patients than in older ones, although the difference is small and can only be demonstrated through careful observations."
26,"What are the key conditions that permit the primary healing of wounds and the healing of grafts? The graft must not be roughly handled, allowed to dry, or subjected to chemical irritation. It must be brought into accurate contact with the new tissue without blood clot intervening, no movement between the two, and all infection must be excluded."
41,"What is a source of interference with repair in wounds? Irritation, either by mechanical agents such as rough, unsuitable dressings, bandages, or ill-fitting splints; or by chemical agents in the form of strong lotions or other applications."
42,"How does an unhealthy or devitalised condition of the patient's tissues affect the reparative process? It hinders the reparative process, as bruised or lacerated skin heals less kindly than skin cut with a smooth, sharp instrument, and persistent venous congestion prevents the access of healthy blood."
