describe: Healing by Primary Union|"Healing by Primary Union.The most favourable conditions for the progress of the reparative process are to be found in a clean-cut wound of the integument, which is uncomplicated by loss of tissue, by the presence of foreign substances, or by infection with disease-producing micro-organisms, and its edges are in contact.Such a wound in virtue of the absence of infection is said to be  aseptic , and under these conditions healing takes place by what is called ""primary union"" the ""healing by first intention"" of the older writers.Granulation Tissue.The essential and invariable medium of repair in all structures is an elementary form of new tissue known as  granulation tissue , which is produced in the damaged area in response to the irritation caused by injury or disease.The vital reaction induced by such irritation results in dilatation of the vessels of the part, emigration of leucocytes, transudation of lymph, and certain proliferative changes in the fixed tissue cells."
describe: Formation of Granulation Tissue|Formation of Granulation Tissue.When a wound is made in the integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon coagulates on the cut surfaces.In each of the divided vessels a clot forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and devitalised tissue.If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary uniting medium between the divided surfaces.During the first twelve hours, the minute vessels in the vicinity of the wound dilate, and from them lymph exudes and leucocytes migrate into the tissues.In from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the capillaries of the part adjacent to the wound begin to throw out minute buds and fine processes, which bridge the gap and form a firmer, but still temporary, connection between the two sides.
describe: Formation of Cicatricial Tissue|Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries, until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by cicatricial tissue.In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated, and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction  cicatricial contraction .Healing of Epidermis.
describe: Healing of Epidermis|Healing of Epidermis.While these changes are taking place in the deeper parts of the wound, the surface is being covered over by  epidermis  growing in from the margins.Within twelve hours the cells of the rete Malpighii close to the cut edge begin to sprout on to the surface of the wound, and by their proliferation gradually cover the granulations with a thin pink pellicle.As the epithelium increases in thickness it assumes a bluish hue and eventually the cells become cornified and the epithelium assumes a greyish-white colour.Clinical Aspects.So long as the process of repair is not complicated by infection with micro-organisms, there is no interference with the general health of the patient.
describe: Healing by Union|Healing by Union of two Granulating Surfaces.In gaping wounds union is sometimes obtained by bringing the two surfaces into apposition after each has become covered with healthy granulations.The exudate on the surfaces causes them to adhere, capillary loops pass from one to the other, and their final fusion takes place by the further development of granulation and cicatricial tissue.Reunion of Parts entirely Separated from the Body.Small portions of tissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of the external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately replaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.In the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or even a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.
describe: Reunion of Parts|Reunion of Parts entirely Separated from the Body.Small portions of tissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of the external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately replaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.In the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or even a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.Healing under a Scab.When a small superficial wound is exposed to the air, the blood and serum exuded on its surface may dry and form a hard crust or  scab , which serves to protect the surface from external irritation in the same way as would a dry pad of sterilised gauze.Under this scab the formation of granulation tissue, its transformation into cicatricial tissue, and the growth of epithelium on the surface, go on until in the course of time the crust separates, leaving a scar.
describe: Skin and Connective Tissue|REPAIR IN INDIVIDUAL TISSUES  Skin and Connective Tissue.The mode of regeneration of these tissues under aseptic conditions has already been described as the type of ideal repair.In highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative process goes on with great rapidity, and even extensive wounds may be firmly united in from three to five days.Where the anastomosis is less free the process is more prolonged.The more highly organised elements of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands, are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and hairless.Epithelium.
describe: Nerve Tissues|Nerve Tissues.There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place.Any loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.The repair of  Bone ,  Blood Vessels , and  Peripheral Nerves  is more conveniently considered in the chapters dealing with these structures.Rate of Healing.While the rate at which wounds heal is remarkably constant there are certain factors that influence it in one direction or the other.
describe: Preservation of Tissues|Preservation of Tissues for Grafting.It was at one time believed that tissues might be taken from the operating theatre and kept in cold storage until they were required.It is now agreed that tissues which have been separated from the body for some time inevitably lose their vitality, become incapable of regeneration, and are therefore unsuited for grafting purposes.If it is intended to preserve a portion of tissue for future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall until it is wanted; this has been carried out with portions of costal cartilage and of bone.INDIVIDUAL TISSUES AS GRAFTS  The Blood  lends itself in an ideal manner to transplantation, or, as it has long been called,  transfusion .Being always a homoplastic transfer, the new blood is not always tolerated by the old, in which case biochemical changes occur, resulting in hamolysis, which corresponds to the disintegration of other unsuccessful homoplastic grafts.
describe: Transfusion|"(See article on Transfusion,  Op.Surg., p.37.)The Skin.The skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting purposes, and it is still employed with greater frequency than any other, as lesions causing defects of skin are extremely common and without the aid of grafts are tedious in healing.Transfusion of blood is most valuable as  a preliminary to operation  in patients who are bloodless as a result of hamorrhage from gastric and duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown.There is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the composition of the blood.The affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an affected family being liable to suffer.Its mode of transmission to individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency is transmitted through the female line."
describe: pinal canal|"The serum may be introduced directly into a vein, or into the spinal canal,  e.g.anti-tetanic serum.The immunity produced by injections of antitoxic sera lasts only for a comparatively short time, seldom longer than a few weeks.""Serum Disease"" and Anaphylaxis.It is to be borne in mind that some patients exhibit a supersensitiveness with regard to protective sera, an injection being followed in a few days by the appearance of an urticarial or erythematous rash, pain and swelling of the joints, and a variable degree of fever.These symptoms, to which the name  serum disease  is applied, usually disappear in the course of a few days."
describe: Staphylococcus Aureus|Staphylococcus Aureus.This is the commonest organism found in localised inflammatory and suppurative conditions.It varies greatly in its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone.As seen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the individual cells taking place irregularly (Fig.2).When grown in artificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour hence the name  aureus .INFECTIONS THROUGH THE BLOOD-STREAM  Diseases caused by the Staphylococcus Aureus.As the majority of pyogenic diseases are due to infection with the staphylococcus aureus, these will be described first.Acute osteomyelitis  is a suppurative process beginning in the marrow and tending to spread to the periosteum.The disease is common in children, but is rare after the skeleton has attained maturity.Boys are affected more often than girls, in the proportion of three to one, probably because they are more liable to exposure, to injury, and to violent exertion.Etiology.
describe: Streptococcus Pyogenes|Streptococcus Pyogenes.This organism also varies greatly in its virulence; in some instances for example in erysipelas it causes a sharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other conditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves fatal.The streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.At the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes which would otherwise exercise their protective influence.Streptococci invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and throat.Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading gangrene and pyamia.
describe: Bacillus Coli Communis|Bacillus Coli Communis.This organism, which is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract, shows a great tendency to invade any organ or tissue whose vitality is lowered.It is causatively associated with such conditions as peritonitis and peritoneal suppuration resulting from strangulated hernia, appendicitis, or perforation in any part of the alimentary canal.In cystitis, pyelitis, abscess of the kidney, suppuration in the bile-ducts or liver, and in many other abdominal conditions, it plays a most important part.The discharge from wounds infected by this organism has usually a fœtid, or even a facal odour, and often contains gases resulting from putrefaction.It is a small rod-shaped organism with short flagella, which render it motile (Fig.
describe: Bacillus Typhosus|Bacillus Typhosus.This organism has been found in pure culture in suppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal organs, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever.Like the staphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods.Other Pyogenic Bacteria.It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.Most of these will receive further mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.
describe: micrococcus|It is not necessary to do more than name some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus.Most of these will receive further mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.Leucocytosis.Most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other pathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number of leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system.This condition of the blood, which is known as  leucocytosis , is believed to be due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the bone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and destruction of the invading organisms or toxins.To increase the resisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial leucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of nucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent.
describe: Glycogen Reaction|"The Iodine or Glycogen Reaction.The leucocyte count may be supplemented by staining films of the blood with a watery solution of iodine and potassium iodide.In all advancing purulent conditions, in septic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated with ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are stained a brown or reddish-brown colour, due to the action of the iodine on some substance in the cells of the nature of glycogen.This reaction is absent in serous effusions, in unmixed tuberculous infections, in uncomplicated typhoid fever, and in the early stages of cancerous growths.CHAPTER III INFLAMMATION

Definition Nature of inflammation from surgical point of     view Sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation Clinical     aspects of inflammation General principles of treatment Chronic     inflammation.Inflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs in the tissues in response to irritation."
describe: nflammation|These changes are common to the processes of inflammation and repair; no hard-and-fast line can be drawn between these processes, and the two may go on together.It is, however, only when the proliferative changes have come to predominate that the reparative process is effectively established by the production of healthy granulation tissue.Formation of Granulation Tissue.When a wound is made in the integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon coagulates on the cut surfaces.In each of the divided vessels a clot forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and devitalised tissue.If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary uniting medium between the divided surfaces.PYOGENIC BACTERIA From the point of view of the surgeon the most important varieties of micro-organisms are those that cause inflammation and suppuration the  pyogenic bacteria .This group includes a great many species, and these are so widely distributed that they are to be met with under all conditions of everyday life.The nature of the inflammatory and suppurative processes will be considered in detail later; suffice it here to say that they are brought about by the action of one or other of the organisms that we have now to consider.It is found that the  staphylococci , which cluster into groups, tend to produce localised lesions; while the chain-forms  streptococci  give rise to diffuse, spreading conditions.Many varieties of pyogenic bacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli communis.Staphylococcus Aureus.
describe: hamorrhagic|Thus it may be  serous , as in some forms of synovitis;  sero-fibrinous , as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming adhesions;  croupous , when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a false membrane, as in diphtheria;  hamorrhagic  when mixed with blood; or  purulent , when suppuration has occurred.The protective effects of the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes.The lymph contains the opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist the attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective antibodies which neutralise the toxins.The polymorph leucocytes are the principal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.If the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful, the irritant effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and  resolution  is said to take place.Certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore the condition to the normal, and  repair  ensues after the manner already described.
describe: General Treatment|General Treatment.The patient should be kept at rest, preferably in bed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be restricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and these may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if necessary.To counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into the circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms of infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicamia, and tetanus.In other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the opsonic power of the blood.When such means are not available, the circulating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of bland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.The elimination of the toxins is promoted by securing free action of the emunctories.
describe: amœboid movement|"These act as phagocytes, their function being to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and this performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of their amœboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing fibroblasts.Beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play any direct part in the reparative process.These young capillary loops, with their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue, which is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it begins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.If a film of fresh pus is examined under the microscope, the pus cells are seen to have a well-defined rounded outline, and to contain a finely granular protoplasm and a multi-partite nucleus; if still warm, the cells may exhibit amœboid movement.In stained films the nuclei take the stain well.In older pus cells the outline is irregular, the protoplasm coarsely granular, and the nuclei disintegrated, no longer taking the stain.Variations from Typical Pus.Pus from old-standing sinuses is often watery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells.Where the granulations are vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with red corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris mixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to be ""grumous."""
describe: Typical Pus|"Variations from Typical Pus.Pus from old-standing sinuses is often watery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells.Where the granulations are vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with red corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris mixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to be ""grumous.""The  odour  of pus varies with the different bacteria producing it.Pus due to ordinary pyogenic cocci has a mawkish odour; when putrefactive organisms are present it has a putrid odour; when it forms in the vicinity of the intestinal canal it usually contains the bacillus coli communis and has a facal odour.The  colour  of pus also varies: when due to one or other of the varieties of the bacillus pyocyaneus, it is usually of a blue or green colour; when mixed with bile derivatives or altered blood pigment, it may be of a bright orange colour."
describe: Acute Circumscribed Abscess|Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.In the initial stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and suppuration.An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative process is spreading.The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the surface.
describe: anti-streptococcic|The general treatment of toxamia must be carried out, and in cases due to infection by streptococci, anti-streptococcic serum may be used.In a few cases, amputation well above the seat of disease, by removing the source of toxin production, offers the only means of saving the patient.WHITLOW The clinical term whitlow is applied to an acute infection, usually followed by suppuration, commonly met with in the fingers, less frequently in the toes.The point of infection is often trivial a pin-prick, a puncture caused by a splinter of wood, a scratch, or even an imperceptible lesion of the skin.Several varieties of whitlow are recognised, but while it is convenient to describe them separately, it is to be clearly understood that clinically they merge one into another, and it is not always possible to determine in which connective-tissue plane a given infection has originated.Initial Stage.It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the proper strain of streptococcus.It is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are rigidly carried out.DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.
describe: Initial Stage|Initial Stage.Attention is usually first attracted to the condition by a sensation of tightness in the finger and tenderness when the part is squeezed or knocked against anything.In the course of a few hours the part becomes red and swollen; there is continuous pain, which soon assumes a throbbing character, particularly when the hand is dependent, and may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and the patient may feel generally out of sorts.If a constricting band is applied at this stage, the infection can usually be checked and the occurrence of suppuration prevented.If this fails, or if the condition is allowed to go untreated, the inflammatory reaction increases and terminates in suppuration, giving rise to one or other of the forms of whitlow to be described.The Purulent Blister.
describe: The Purulent Blister|The Purulent Blister.In the most superficial variety, pus forms between the rete Malpighii and the stratum corneum of the skin, the latter being raised as a blister in which fluctuation can be detected (Fig.9, a).This is commonly met with in the palm of the hand of labouring men who have recently resumed work after a spell of idleness.When the blister forms near the tip of the finger, the pus burrows under the nail which corresponds to the stratum corneum raising it from its bed.There is some local heat and discoloration, and considerable pain and tenderness, but little or no constitutional disturbance.
describe: Clinical Examination|Clinical Examination of an Ulcer.In examining any ulcer, we observe (1) Its  base  or  floor , noting the presence or absence of granulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and whether they are depressed or elevated in relation to the surrounding parts.(2) The  discharge  as to quantity, consistence, colour, composition, and odour.(3) The  edges , noting particularly whether or not the marginal epithelium is attempting to grow over the surface; also their shape, regularity, thickness, and whether undermined or overlapping, everted or depressed.(4) The  surrounding tissues , as to whether they are congested, œdematous, inflamed, indurated, or otherwise.(5) Whether or not there is  pain  or tenderness in the raw surface or its surroundings.
describe: Classification of Ulcers|Classification of Ulcers.The nomenclature of ulcers is much involved and gives rise to great confusion, chiefly for the reason that no one basis of classification has been adopted.Thus some ulcers are named according to the causes at work in producing or maintaining them for example, the traumatic, the septic, and the varicose ulcer; some from the constitutional element present, as the gouty and the diabetic ulcer; and others according to the condition in which they happen to be when seen by the surgeon, such as the weak, the inflamed, and the callous ulcer.So long as we retain these names it will be impossible to find a single basis for classification; and yet many of the terms are so descriptive and so generally understood that it is undesirable to abolish them.We must therefore remain content with a clinical arrangement of ulcers, it cannot be called a classification, considering any given ulcer from two points of view: first its  cause , and second its  present condition .This method of studying ulcers has the practical advantage that it furnishes us with the main indications for treatment as well as for diagnosis: the cause must be removed, and the condition so modified as to convert the ulcer into an aseptic healing sore.
describe: Traumatism|According to cause:      Traumatism ,  Imperfect circulation ,  Imperfect nerve-supply ,      Constitutional causes  B.According to condition:  Healing ,      Stationary ,  Spreading .Treatment.The process of  ulceration  may be defined as the molecular or cellular death of tissue taking place on a free surface.It is essentially of the same nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent discharge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an abscess, at once escapes on the surface.An  ulcer  is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain conditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of repair.Although any given ulcer may be due to a combination of causes, it is convenient to describe the following groups:  Ulcers due to Traumatism.Traumatism in the form of a  crush  or  bruise  is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by directly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it is rendered a suitable soil for bacteria.If these gain access, in the course of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish colour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an unhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.Heat  and  prolonged exposure to the Röntgen rays  or  to radium emanations  act in a similar way.The  pressure  of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so far interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the skin sloughs, leaving an open sore.This is most liable to occur in patients who suffer from some nerve lesion such as anterior poliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.
describe: syringo-myelia|"The  perforating ulcer of the foot  is a peculiar type of sore which occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis, and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia (Fig.15).It also occurs in patients suffering from glycosuria, and is usually associated with arterio-sclerosis local or general.Perforating ulcer is met with most frequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.A callosity forms and suppuration occurs under it, the pus escaping through a small hole in the centre.The process slowly and gradually spreads deeper and deeper, till eventually the bone or joint is reached, and becomes implicated in the destructive process hence the term ""perforating ulcer."""
describe: grey shreddy|The base is soft, pale, and covered with feeble granulations and grey shreddy sloughs.The edges are of a dull blue or purple colour, and gradually thin out towards their free margins, and in addition are characteristically undermined, so that a probe can be passed for some distance between the floor of the ulcer and the thinned-out edges.Thin, devitalised tags of skin often stretch from side to side of the ulcer.The outline is irregular; small perforations often occur through the skin, and a thin, watery discharge, containing grey shreds of tuberculous debris, escapes.Bazin's Disease.This term is applied to an affection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue which bears certain resemblances to tuberculosis.
describe: rficial syphilitic gummata|The condition begins by the formation in the skin and subcutaneous tissue of dusky or livid nodules of induration, which soften and ulcerate, forming small open sores with ragged and undermined edges, not unlike those resulting from the breaking down of superficial syphilitic gummata (Fig.16).Fresh crops of nodules appear in the neighbourhood of the ulcers, and in turn break down.While in the nodular stage the affection is sometimes painful, but with the formation of the ulcer the pain subsides.The disease runs a chronic course, and may slowly extend over a wide area in spite of the usual methods of treatment.After lasting for some months, or even years, however, it may eventually undergo spontaneous cure.
describe: Traumatic Group|Traumatic Group.The  prophylaxis  of these ulcers consists in excluding bacteria, by cleansing crushed or bruised parts, and applying sterilised dressings and properly adjusted splints.If there is reason to fear that the disinfection has not been complete, a Bier's constricting bandage should be applied for some hours each day.These measures will often prevent a grossly injured portion of skin dying, and will ensure asepticity should it do so.In the event of the skin giving way, the same form of dressing should be continued till the slough has separated and a healthy granulating surface is formed.The protective dressing appropriate to a healing sore is then substituted.
describe: the intra-venou|"No ulcerative process responds so readily to medicinal treatment as the  syphilitic ulcer  does to the intra-venous administration of arsenical preparations of the ""606"" or ""914"" groups or to full doses of iodide of potassium and mercury, and the local application of black wash.When the ulceration has lasted for a long time, however, and is widespread and deep, the duration of treatment is materially shortened by a thorough scraping with the sharp spoon.Treatment in relation to the Condition of the Ulcer.Ulcers in a weak condition.If the weak condition of the ulcer is due to anamia or kidney disease, these affections must first be treated.Locally, the imperfect granulations should be scraped away, and some stimulating agent applied to the raw surface to promote the growth of healthy granulations.When the intra-venous method is not available, one or two pints of saline solution with adrenalin should be slowly introduced into the rectum, by means of a long rubber tube and a filler.Satisfactory, although less rapidly obtained results follow the introduction of saline solution into the cellular tissue for example, under the mamma, into the axilla, or under the skin of the back.If the patient can retain fluids taken by the mouth such as hot coffee, barley water, or soda water these should be freely given, unless the injury necessitates operative treatment under a general anasthetic.Transfusion of blood is most valuable as  a preliminary to operation  in patients who are bloodless as a result of hamorrhage from gastric and duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.HAMOPHILIA The term hamophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the patient liable to serious hamorrhage from even the most trivial injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as ""bleeders.""The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown."
describe: Ambulatory Treatment|Ambulatory Treatment.When the circumstances of the patient forbid his lying up in bed, the healing of the ulcer is much delayed.He should be instructed to take every possible opportunity of placing the limb in an elevated position, and must constantly wear a firm bandage of  elastic webbing .This webbing is porous and admits of evaporation of the skin and wound secretions an advantage it has over Martin's rubber bandage.The bandage should extend from the toes to well above the knee, and should always be applied while the patient is in the recumbent position with the leg elevated, preferably before getting out of bed in the morning.Additional support is given to the veins if the bandage is applied as a figure of eight.
describe: Dry Gangrene|Dry Gangrene  or  Mummification  is a comparatively slow form of local death due, as a rule, to a diminution in the arterial blood supply of the affected part, resulting from such causes as the gradual narrowing of the lumen of the arteries by disease of their coats, or the blocking of the main vessel by an embolus.As the fluids in the tissues are lost by evaporation the part becomes dry and shrivelled, and as the skin is usually intact, infection does not take place, or if it does, the want of moisture renders the part an unsuitable soil, and the organisms do not readily find a footing.Any spread of the process that may take place is chiefly influenced by the anatomical distribution of the blocked arteries, and is arrested as soon as it reaches an area rich in anastomotic vessels.The dead portion is then cast off, the irritation resulting from the contact of the dead with the still living tissue inducing the formation of granulations on the proximal side of the junction, and these by slowly eating into the dead portion produce a furrow the  line of demarcation  which gradually deepens until complete separation is effected.As the muscles and bones have a richer blood supply than the integument, the death of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of muscles and bone, with the result that the stump left after spontaneous separation is conical, the end of the bone projecting beyond the soft parts.Clinical Features.
describe: Heat, Chemical Agents|Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.Severe  burns  and  scalds  may be followed by necrosis of tissue.So long as the parts are kept absolutely dry as, for example, by the picric acid method of treatment the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene; but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access, moist gangrene follows.Strong  chemical agents , such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of the lesions produced being like those of severe burns.The resulting sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which are long of healing.Carbolic Gangrene.
describe: Carbolic Gangrene|Carbolic Gangrene.Carbolic acid, even in comparatively weak solution, is liable to induce dry gangrene when applied as a fomentation to a finger, especially in women and children.Thrombosis occurs in the blood vessels of the part, which at first is pale and soft, but later becomes dark and leathery.On account of the anasthetic action of carbolic acid, the onset of the process is painless, and the patient does not realise his danger.A line of demarcation soon forms, but the dead part separates very slowly.Gangrene from Frost-bite.
describe: Spasm of Blood Vessels|Gangrene associated with Spasm of Blood Vessels.Raynaud's Disease , or symmetrical gangrene, is supposed to be due to spasm of the arterioles, resulting from peripheral neuritis.It occurs oftenest in women, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, who are the subjects of uterine disorders, anamia, or chlorosis.Cold is an aggravating factor, as the disease is commonest during the winter months.The digits of both hands or the toes of both feet are simultaneously attacked, and the disease seldom spreads beyond the phalanges or deeper than the skin.The first evidence is that the fingers become cold, white, and insensitive to touch and pain.
describe: Clinical Varieties|Clinical Varieties of Bacillary Gangrene.Acute infective gangrene  is the form most commonly met with in civil practice.It may follow such trivial injuries as a pin-prick or a scratch, the signs of acute cellulitis rapidly giving place to those of a spreading gangrene.Or it may ensue on a severe railway, machinery, or street accident, when lacerated and bruised tissues are contaminated with gross dirt.Often within a few hours of the injury the whole part rapidly becomes painful, swollen, œdematous, and tense.The skin is at first glazed, and perhaps paler than normal, but soon assumes a dull red or purplish hue, and bulla form on the surface.Clinical Varieties of Tetanus.Acute  or  Fulminating Tetanus .This variety is characterised by the shortness of the incubation period, the rapidity of its progress, the severity of its symptoms, and its all but universally fatal issue in spite of treatment, death taking place in from one to four days.The characteristic symptoms may appear within three or four days of the infliction of the wound, but the incubation period may extend to three weeks, and the wound may be quite healed before the disease declares itself  delayed tetanus .Usually, however, the wound is inflamed and suppurating, with ragged and sloughy edges.A slight feverish attack may mark the onset of the tetanic condition, or the patient may feel perfectly well until the spasms begin.
describe: Gas Gangrene|Acute Emphysematous  or  Gas Gangrene  was prevalent in certain areas at various periods during the European War.It follows infection of lacerated wounds with the  bacillus arogenes capsulatus , usually in combination with other anaërobes, and its main incidence is on the muscles, which rapidly become infiltrated with gas that spreads throughout the whole extent of the muscle, disintegrating its fibres and leading to necrosis.The gangrenous process spreads with appalling rapidity, the limb becoming enormously swollen, painful, and crepitant or even tympanitic.Patches of coppery or purple colour appear on the skin, and bulla containing blood-stained serum form on the surface.The toxamia is profound, and the face and lips assume a characteristic cyanosis.The condition is attended with a high mortality.
describe: Excoriations|Excoriations, which may develop into true bed-sores, sometimes form where two skin surfaces remain constantly apposed, as in the region of the scrotum or labium, under pendulous mamma, or between fingers or toes confined in a splint.Clinical Features.Two clinical varieties are met with the acute and the chronic bed-sore.The  acute  bed-sore usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock.It develops rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain brain diseases.The part affected becomes red and congested, while the surrounding parts are œdematous and swollen, blisters form, and the skin loses its vitality (Fig.
describe: the anti-streptococcic serum|It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the proper strain of streptococcus.It is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are rigidly carried out.DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.
describe: Klebs-Löffler|DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific bacterium, the  bacillus diphtheria  or  Klebs-Löffler bacillus .The disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions.The incubation period varies from two to seven days.Clinical Features.In  pharyngeal diphtheria , on the first or second day of the disease, redness and swelling of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, tonsils, and palate are well marked, and small, circular greenish or grey patches of false membrane, composed of necrosed epithelium, fibrin, leucocytes, and red blood corpuscles, begin to appear.The finding of the Klebs-Löffler bacillus is the only conclusive evidence of the disease.The bacillus may be obtained by swabbing the throat with a piece of aseptic not antiseptic cotton wool or clean linen rag held in a pair of forceps, and rotated so as to entangle portions of the false membrane or exudate.The swab thus obtained is placed in a test-tube, previously sterilised by having had some water boiled in it, and sent to a laboratory for investigation.To identify the bacillus a piece of the membrane from the swab is rubbed on a cover glass, dried, and stained with methylene blue or other basic stain; or cultures may be made on agar or other suitable medium.When a bacteriological examination is impossible, or when the clinical features do not coincide with the results obtained, the patient should always be treated on the assumption that he suffers from diphtheria.So much doubt exists as to the real nature of membranous croup and its relationship to true diphtheria, that when the diagnosis between the two is uncertain the safest plan is to treat the case as one of diphtheria.
describe: ronic variety|In man , acute glanders is commoner than the chronic variety.Infection always takes place through an abraded surface, and usually on one of the uncovered parts of the body most commonly the skin of the hands, arms, or face; or on the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eye.The disease has been acquired by accidental inoculation in the course of experimental investigations in the laboratory, and proved fatal.The incubation period is from three to five days.The  local  manifestations are pain and swelling in the region of the infected wound, with inflammatory redness around it and along the lines of the superficial lymphatics.In the course of a week, small, firm nodules appear, and are rapidly transformed into pustules.In man  also the clinical features of the chronic variety of the disease are somewhat different from those of the acute form.Here, too, infection takes place through a broken cutaneous surface, and leads to a superficial lymphangitis with nodular thickening of the lymphatics ( farcy buds ).The neighbouring glands soon become swollen and indurated.The primary lesion meanwhile inflames, suppurates, and, after breaking down, leaves a large, irregular ulcer with thickened edges and a foul, purulent or bloody discharge.The glands break down in the same way, and lead to wide destruction of skin, and the resulting sinuses and ulcers are exceedingly intractable.Secondary deposits in the subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, and other parts, are not uncommon, and the nasal mucous membrane may become involved.
describe: Artificial Hyperamia|Artificial Hyperamia.When such direct means as the above are impracticable, much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by improving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area, so as to ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it.The beneficial effects of  hot fomentations and poultices  depend on their causing a dilatation of the vessels, and so inducing a hyperamia in the affected area.It has been shown experimentally that repeated, short applications of moist heat (not exceeding 106° F.) are more efficacious than continuous application.It is now believed that the so-called  counter-irritants  mustard, iodine, cantharides, actual cautery act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by applying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based on the same principle.While these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years that their mode of action has been properly understood, and to August Bier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a scientific and rational basis.Artificial Hyperamia.As has been explained, the induction of hyperamia by the method devised by Bier, constitutes one of our most efficient means of combating bacterial infection.The treatment of tuberculosis on this plan has been proved by experience to be a valuable addition to our therapeutic measures, and the simplicity of its application has led to its being widely adopted in practice.It results in an increase in the reactive changes around the tuberculous focus, an increase in the immigration of leucocytes, and infiltration with the lymphocytes.The constricting bandage should be applied at some distance above the seat of infection; for instance, in disease of the wrist, it is put on above the elbow, and it must not cause pain either where it is applied or in the diseased part.The bandage is only applied for a few hours each day, either two hours at a time or twice a day for one hour, and, while it is on, all dressings are removed save a piece of sterile gauze over any wound or sinus that may be present.
describe: Beck of Chicago|It was found by Beck of Chicago that the injection of bismuth paste is frequently followed by healing of the sinus, and that, if one injection fails to bring about a cure, repeating the injection every second day may be successful.Some caution must be observed in this treatment, as symptoms of poisoning have been observed to follow its use.If they manifest themselves, an injection of warm olive oil should be given; the oil, left in for twelve hours or so, forms an emulsion with the bismuth, which can be withdrawn by aspiration.Iodoform suspended in glycerin may be employed in a similar manner.When these and other non-operative measures fail, and the whole track of the sinus is accessible, it should be laid open, scraped, and packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze until it heals from the bottom.The  tuberculous ulcer  is described in the chapter on ulcers.
describe: SYPHILIS Transmission  Clinical|INHERITED     SYPHILIS Transmission  Clinical features in infancy, in later     life  Contagiousness Treatment.Syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a specific virus.It is nearly always communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion being the medium through which the virus is transmitted, and the seat of inoculation is almost invariably a surface covered by squamous epithelium.The disease was unknown in Europe before the year 1493, when it was introduced into Spain by Columbus' crew, who were infected in Haiti, where the disease had been endemic from time immemorial (Bloch).The granulation tissue which forms as a result of the reaction of the tissues to the presence of the virus is chiefly composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with an abundant new formation of capillary blood vessels.Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells, which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are practically absent.
describe: endothelioid|Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells, which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are practically absent.When syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the condition is spoken of as  acquired syphilis , and the first visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation, and is known as  the primary lesion .Those who have thus acquired the disease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer from  inherited syphilis .The Virus of Syphilis.The cause of syphilis, whether acquired or inherited, is the organism, described by Schaudinn and Hoffman, in 1905, under the name of  spirochata pallida  or  spironema pallidum .It is a delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 µ and in width about 0.25 µ, and is distinguished from other spirochates by its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same during rest and in active movement (Fig.

describe: D'Arcy Power|ii., edited by D'Arcy Power and J. Keogh Murphy, Oxford Medical Publications.The Soft Sore, Soft Chancre, or Chancroid.The differential diagnosis of syphilis necessitates the consideration of the  soft sore ,  soft chancre , or  chancroid , which is also a common form of venereal disease, and is due to infection with a virulent pus-forming bacillus, first described by Ducrey in 1889.Ducrey's bacillus occurs in the form of minute oval rods measuring about 1.5 µ in length, which stain readily with any basic aniline dye, but are quickly decolorised by Gram's method.They are found mixed with other organisms in the purulent discharge from the sore, and are chiefly arranged in small groups or in short chains.Soft sores are always contracted by direct contact from another individual, and the incubation period is a short one of from two to five days.

describe: fourchette|They are usually situated in the vicinity of the franum, and, in women, about the labia minora or fourchette; they probably originate in abrasions in these situations.They appear as pustules, which are rapidly converted into small, acutely inflamed ulcers with sharply cut, irregular margins, which bleed easily and yield an abundant yellow purulent discharge.They are devoid of the induration of syphilis, are painful, and nearly always multiple, reproducing themselves in successive crops by auto-inoculation.Soft sores are often complicated by phimosis and balanitis, and they frequently lead to infection of the glands in the groin.The resulting bubo is ill-defined, painful, and tender, and suppuration occurs in about one-fourth of the cases.The overlying skin becomes adherent and red, and suppuration takes place either in the form of separate foci in the interior of the individual glands, or around them; in the latter case, on incision, the glands are found lying bathed in pus.
describe: Condylomata|Condylomata  are more characteristic of syphilis than any other type of skin lesion.They are papules occurring on those parts of the body where the skin is habitually moist, and especially where two skin surfaces are in contact.They are chiefly met with on the external genitals, especially in women, around the anus, beneath large pendulous mamma, between the toes, and at the angles of the mouth, and in these situations their development is greatly favoured by neglect of cleanliness.They present the appearance of well-defined circular or ovoid areas in which the skin is thickened and raised above the surface; they are covered with a white sodden epidermis, and furnish a scanty but very infective discharge.Under the influence of irritation and want of rest, as at the anus or at the angle of the mouth, they are apt to become fissured and superficially ulcerated, and the discharge then becomes abundant and may crust on the surface, forming yellow scabs.At the angle of the mouth the condylomatous patches may spread to the cheek, and when they ulcerate may leave fissure-like scars radiating from the mouth an appearance best seen in inherited syphilis (Fig.
describe: The Affections of the Eyes|The Affections of the Eyes , although fortunately rare, are of great importance because of the serious results which may follow if they are not recognised and treated.Iritis  is the commonest of these, and may occur in one or in both eyes, one after the other, from three to eight months after infection.The patient complains of impairment of sight and of frontal or supraorbital pain.The eye waters and is hypersensitive, the iris is discoloured and reacts sluggishly to light, and there is a zone of ciliary congestion around the cornea.The appearance of minute white nodules or flakes of lymph at the margin of the pupil is especially characteristic of syphilitic iritis.When adhesions have formed between the iris and the structures in relation to it, the pupil dilates irregularly under atropin.
describe: Serum Diagnosis Wassermann Reaction|Serum Diagnosis Wassermann Reaction.Wassermann found that if an extract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochates is mixed with the serum from a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed.The application of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried out by an expert pathologist.For the purpose he is supplied with from 5 c.c.to 10 c.c.of the patient's blood, withdrawn under aseptic conditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and transferred to a clean and dry glass tube.
describe: The Administration of Mercury|The Administration of Mercury.The success of the arsenical preparations has diminished the importance of mercury in the treatment of syphilis, but it is still used to supplement the effect of the injections.The amount of mercury to be given in any case must be proportioned to the idiosyncrasies of the patient, and it is advisable, before commencing the treatment, to test his urine and record his body-weight.The small amount of mercury given at the outset is gradually increased.If the body-weight falls, or if the gums become sore and the breath foul, the mercury should be stopped for a time.If salivation occurs, the drinking of hot water and the taking of hot baths should be insisted upon, and half-dram doses of the alkaline sulphates prescribed.
describe: grey powder|This was for long the most popular method in this country, the preparation usually employed being grey powder, in pills or tablets, each of which contains one grain of the powder.Three of these are given daily in the first instance, and the daily dose is increased to five or even seven grains till the standard for the individual patient is arrived at.As the grey powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be combined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg.c. cret.gr.1; ferri sulph.As the grey powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be combined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg.c. cret.gr.1; ferri sulph.exsiccat.gr.
describe: The General Health|The General Health.The patient must lead a regular life and cultivate the fresh-air habit, which is as beneficial in syphilis as in tuberculosis.Anamia, malaria, and other sources of debility must receive appropriate treatment.The diet should be simple and easily digested, and should include a full supply of milk.Alcohol is prohibited.The excretory organs are encouraged to act by the liberal drinking of hot water between meals, say five or six tumblerfuls in the twenty-four hours.
describe: The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage|The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage.Before the introduction of the Ehrlich-Hata treatment no patient was allowed to marry until three years had elapsed after the disappearance of the last manifestation.While marriage might be entered upon under these conditions without risk of the husband infecting the wife, the possibility of his conveying the disease to the offspring cannot be absolutely excluded.It is recommended, as a precautionary measure, to give a further mercurial course of two or three months' duration before marriage, and an intravenous injection of an arsenical preparation.Intermediate Stage.After the dying away of the secondary manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the patient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called  reminders .
describe: Tertiary Syphilis|Tertiary Syphilis.While the manifestations of primary and secondary syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.It is to be borne in mind that in a certain proportion of men and in a larger proportion of women, the patient has no knowledge of having suffered from syphilis.Certain slight but important signs may give the clue in a number of cases, such as irregularity of the pupils or failure to react to light, abnormality of the reflexes, and the discovery of patches of leucoplakia on the tongue, cheek, or palate.The  general character of tertiary manifestations  may be stated as follows: They attack by preference the tissues derived from the mesoblastic layer of the embryo the cellular tissue, bones, muscles, and viscera.They are often localised to one particular tissue or organ, such, for example, as the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the bones, or the liver, and they are rarely symmetrical.
describe: spirochates|It is a delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 µ and in width about 0.25 µ, and is distinguished from other spirochates by its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same during rest and in active movement (Fig.36).In a fresh specimen, such as a scraping from a hard chancre suspended in a little salt solution, it shows active movements.The organism is readily destroyed by heat, and perishes in the absence of moisture.It has been proved experimentally that it remains infective only up to six hours after its removal from the body.Noguchi has succeeded in obtaining pure cultures from the infected tissues of the rabbit.Noguchi has made an emulsion of dead spirochates which he calls  luetin , and which gives a specific reaction resembling that of tuberculin in tuberculosis, a papule or a pustule forming at the site of the intra-dermal injection.It is said to be most efficacious in the tertiary and latent forms of syphilis, which are precisely those forms in which the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties.ACQUIRED SYPHILIS In the vast majority of cases, infection takes place during the congress of the sexes.Delicate, easily abraded surfaces are then brought into contact, and the discharge from lesions containing the virus is placed under favourable conditions for conveying the disease from one person to the other.In the male the possibility of infection taking place is increased if the virus is retained under cover of a long and tight prepuce, and if there are abrasions on the surface with which it comes in contact.The frequency with which infection takes place on the genitals during sexual intercourse warrants syphilis being considered a venereal disease, although there are other ways in which it may be contracted.
describe: Choroiditis|Choroiditis  and  retinitis  may also occur, and leave permanent changes easily recognised on examination with the ophthalmoscope.Among the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be mentioned gummatous disease in the  larynx and trachea , attended with ulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the  nervous system  which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.In a limited number of cases, about the period of puberty there may develop  deafness , which is usually bilateral and may become absolute.Changes in the Permanent Teeth.These affect specially the upper central incisors, which are dwarfed and stand somewhat apart in the gum, with their free edges converging towards one another.They are tapering or peg-shaped, and present at their cutting margin a deep semilunar notch.
describe: condylomata|It is readily found in the mucous patches and condylomata of the secondary period.It is best stained by Giemsa's method, and its recognition is greatly aided by the use of the ultra-microscope.The spirochate has been demonstrated in every form of syphilitic lesion, and has been isolated from the blood with difficulty and from lymph withdrawn by a hollow needle from enlarged lymph glands.The saliva of persons suffering from syphilitic lesions of the mouth also contains the organism.In tertiary lesions there is greater difficulty in demonstrating the spirochate, but small numbers have been found in the peripheral parts of gummata and in the thickened patches in syphilitic disease of the aorta.Noguchi and Moore have discovered the spirochate in the brain in a number of cases of general paralysis of the insane.The primary lesion may take the form of condylomata.Indurated œdema, with brownish-red or livid discoloration of one or both labia, is diagnostic of syphilis.The hard chancre is usually solitary, but sometimes there are two or more; when there are several, they are individually smaller than the solitary chancre.It is the exception for a hard chancre to leave a visible scar, hence, in examining patients with a doubtful history of syphilis, little reliance can be placed on the presence or absence of a scar on the genitals.When the primary lesion has taken the form of an open ulcer with purulent discharge, or has sloughed, there is a permanent scar.Infection of the adjacent lymph glands  is usually found to have taken place by the time the primary lesion has acquired its characteristic induration.
describe: choroiditis|"While a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may therefore be described as  permanent signs of the inherited disease : Dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded; radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction of the hard palate; Hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis; deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata; ""sabre-blade"" or other deformity of the tibia.The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.In 1837, Colles of Dublin stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the disease.This doctrine, which is known as  Colles' law , is generally accepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.The older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the disease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as it does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.It should be added, however, that the contagiousness of inherited syphilis is denied by some observers, who affirm that, when syphilitic infants prove infective, the disease has been really acquired at or soon after birth."

describe: Bland Sutton|An odontoma is composed of dental tissues in varying proportions and different degrees of development, arising from tooth-germs or from teeth still in process of growth (Bland Sutton).Odontomas resemble teeth in so far that during their development they remain hidden below the mucous membrane and give no evidence of their existence.There then succeeds, usually between the twentieth and twenty-fifth years, an eruptive stage, which is often attended with suppuration, and this may be the means of drawing attention to the tumour.Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their formation.The  epithelial odontoma  is derived from persistent portions of the epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible.The cystic spaces of the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid.Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their formation.The  epithelial odontoma  is derived from persistent portions of the epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible.The cystic spaces of the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid.These tumours have been described by Eve under the name of multilocular cystic epithelial tumours of the jaw.The  follicular odontoma , also known as a  dentigerous cyst , is derived from the distension of a tooth follicle.It constitutes a cyst containing a viscid fluid, and an imperfectly formed tooth is often found embedded in its wall.
describe: Fibromatosis|"Diffuse fibroma  or  Fibromatosis , analogous to lipomatosis, is met with in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and constitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met with in the stomach and colon.Myxoma.A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous, semifluid consistence.The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and clinically resembles the lipoma.Myxomatous tissue is, however, frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.Myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the ""innocent parotid tumour.""Diffuse or Generalised Neuro-Fibromatosis Recklinghausen's Disease.These terms are now used to include what were formerly known as ""multiple neuromata,"" as well as certain other overgrowths related to nerves.The essential lesion is an overgrowth of the endoneural connective tissue throughout the nerves of both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems.The nerves are diffusely and unequally thickened, so that small twigs may become enlarged to the size of the median, while at irregular intervals along their course the connective-tissue overgrowth is exaggerated so as to form tumour-like swellings similar to the trunk-neuroma already described.The tumours, which vary greatly in size and number as many as a thousand have been counted in one case are enclosed in a capsule derived from the perineurium.The fibromatosis may also affect the cranial nerves, the ganglia on the posterior nerve roots, the nerves within the vertebral canal, and the sympathetic nerves and ganglia, as well as the continuations of the motor nerves within the muscles."
describe: semifluid consistence|"A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous, semifluid consistence.The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and clinically resembles the lipoma.Myxomatous tissue is, however, frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.Myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the ""innocent parotid tumour.""Mucous polypus of the nose, which is often described as a myxoma, is merely a pendulous process of œdematous mucous membrane.Myeloma."
describe: Rhabdomyoma|The  Rhabdomyoma  is an extremely rare form of tumour, met with in the kidney, uterus, and testicle.It contains striped muscle fibres, and is supposed to originate from a residue of muscular tissue which has become sequestrated during development.Glioma.A glioma is a tumour composed of neuroglia.It is met with exclusively in the central nervous system, retina, and optic nerve.It is a slowly growing, soft, ill-defined tumour, which displaces the adjacent nerve centres and nerve tracts, and is liable to become the seat of hamorrhage and thus to give rise to pressure symptoms resembling apoplexy.
describe: Endotheliomas|Endotheliomas  take origin from the endothelium of lymph vessels and blood vessels, and serous cavities.They show great variation in type, partly because of the number of different kinds of endothelium from which they are derived, and partly because the new connective tissue which is formed is liable to undergo transformation into other tissues.They may be soft or hard, solid or cystic, diffuse or circumscribed; they grow very slowly, and are almost always innocent, although recurrence has been occasionally observed.Cases of multiple endotheliomata of the skin have recently been described by Wise.Angioma ,  lymphangioma , and  neuroma  are described with the disease of the individual tissues.MALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS SARCOMA The term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which exhibits malignant characters.
describe: The Contagiousness of Cancer|The Contagiousness of Cancer.A limited number of cases are on record in which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from the lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the tongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being all examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or frequently in contact.The transference of cancer from one human being to another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding his finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction of a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known to occur.It is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence takes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent nodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of stitches in its neighbourhood.In the lower animals the grafting of cancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a cancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but only in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was taken.While cancer cannot be regarded as either contagious or infectious, it is important to bear in mind the possibility of infection of a wound with cancer when operating for the disease.
describe: Implantati|Cysts:  Retention ,      Exudation ,  Implantation ,  Parasitic ,  Lymphatic or Serous .Ganglion.For the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book of pathology.A tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly formed tissue which fulfils no physiological function.Tumours increase in size quite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural termination to their growth.They are to be distinguished from such over-growths as are of the nature of simple hypertrophy or local giantism, and also from inflammatory swellings, which usually develop under the influence of a definite cause, have a natural termination, and tend to disappear when the cause ceases to act.Implantation cysts  are caused by the accidental transference of portions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may occur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns.The implanted epidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst.They are met with chiefly on the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea to a cherry.The treatment consists in removing them by dissection.Parasitic cysts  are produced by the growth within the tissues of cyst-forming parasites, the best known being the tania echinococcus, which gives rise to the  hydatid cyst .The liver is by far the most common site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.
describe: Ganglionic|Ganglionic cysts are met with in other situations than those mentioned, but they are so rare as not to require separate description.Ganglia are to be diagnosed by their situation and physical characters; enlarged bursa, synovial cysts, and new-growths are the swellings most likely to be mistaken for them.The diagnosis is sometimes only cleared up by withdrawing the clear, jelly-like contents through a hollow needle.Pathological Anatomy.The wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous tissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so that it cannot be shelled out.There is no endothelial lining, and the fibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid material in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of degeneration from the surrounding connective tissue.
describe: Lacerated Wounds|Contused and Lacerated Wounds.These may be considered together, as they so occur in practice.They are produced by crushing, biting, or tearing forms of violence such as result from machinery accidents, firearms, or the bites of animals.In addition to the irregular wound of the integument, there is always more or less bruising of the parts beneath and around, and the subcutaneous lesions are much wider than appears on the surface.Wounds of this variety usually gape considerably, especially when there is much laceration of the skin.It is not uncommon to have considerable portions of skin, muscle, or tendon completely torn away.
describe: Cicatricial|Formation of Cicatricial Tissue.The transformation of this temporary granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts, which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity till it replaces the cell protoplasm.In this way white fibrous tissue is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white fibrous tissue.In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries, until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by cicatricial tissue.In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated, and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction  cicatricial contraction .Healing of Epidermis.(5) Cicatricial contraction.(6) Gangrene, which may follow occlusion of main vessels, or virulent infective processes.(7) It is not uncommon to have particles of carbon embedded in the tissues after lacerated wounds, leaving unsightly, pigmented scars.This is often seen in coal-miners, and in those injured by firearms, and is to be prevented by removing all gross dirt from the edges of the wound.Treatment.In severe wounds of this class implicating the extremities, the most important question that arises is whether or not the limb can be saved.
describe: Rifle Bullets|Wounds by Rifle Bullets.The vast majority of wounds inflicted by rifle bullets are met with in the field during active warfare, and fall to be treated by military surgeons.They occasionally occur accidentally, however, during range practice for example, and may then come under the notice of the civil surgeon.It is only necessary here to consider the effects of modern small-bore rifle or machine-gun bullets.The trajectory is practically flat up to 675 yards.In destructive effect there is not much difference between the various high velocity bullets used in different armies; they will kill up to a distance of two miles.
describe: hypodermically|"A full dose of morphin is given hypodermically.The ampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents are poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is applied.In extensive wounds, the ""shell-dressing"" carried by the stretcher bearers is preferred.All bandages are applied loosely to allow for subsequent swelling.The fragments of fractured bones are immobilised by some form of emergency splint.2.In some cases hyoscin (1/200 grain) injected hypodermically is found efficacious when all other means have failed, but this drug must be used with great discrimination.The patient must be encouraged to take plenty of easily digested fluid food, supplemented, if necessary, by nutrient enemata and saline infusions.In the early stage a brisk mercurial purge is often of value.Alcohol should be withheld, unless failing of the pulse strongly indicates its use, and then it should be given along with the food.A delirious patient must be constantly watched by a trained attendant or other competent person, lest he get out of bed and do harm to himself or others.Mechanical restraint is often necessary, but must be avoided if possible, as it is apt to increase the excitement and exhaust the patient."
describe: the Field Ambulance or|In the Field Ambulance or Casualty Clearing Station  further measures are employed for the relief of shock, and urgent operations are performed, such as amputation for gangrene, tracheotomy for dyspnœa, or laparotomy for perforated or lacerated intestine.In the majority of cases the main object is to guard against infection; the skin is disinfected over a wide area and surrounded with towels; damaged tissue, especially muscle, is removed with the knife or scissors, and foreign bodies are extracted.Torn blood vessels, and, if possible, nerves and tendons are repaired.The wound is then partly closed, provision being made for free drainage, or some special method of irrigation, such as that of Carrel, is adopted.Sometimes the wound is treated with bismuth, iodoform, and paraffin paste (B.I.P.P.)and sutured.
describe: the Base Hospital|In the Base Hospital or Hospital Ship  various measures may be called for according to the progress of the wound and the condition of the patient.Shell Wounds and Wounds produced by Explosions.It is convenient to consider together the effects of the bursting of shells fired from heavy ordnance and those resulting in the course of blasting operations from the discharge of dynamite or other explosives, or from the bursting of steam boilers or pipes, the breaking of machinery, and similar accidents met with in civil practice.Wounds inflicted by shell fragments and shrapnel bullets tend to be extensive in area, and show great contusion, laceration, and destruction of the tissues.The missiles frequently lodge and carry portions of the clothing and, it may be, articles from the man's pocket, with them.Shell wounds are attended with a considerable degree of shock.
describe: Burns of Second Degree Vesication of the Skin|Burns of Second Degree Vesication of the Skin.These are characterised by the occurrence of vesicles or blisters which are scattered over the hyperamic area, and contain a clear yellowish or brownish fluid.On removing the raised epidermis, the congested and highly sensitive papilla of the skin are exposed.Unna has found that pyogenic bacteria are invariably present in these blisters.Burns of the second degree leave no scar but frequently a persistent discoloration.In rare instances the burned area becomes the seat of a peculiar overgrowth of fibrous tissue of the nature of keloid (p 401).
describe: Burns of Third Degree Partial Destruction of the Skin|Burns of Third Degree Partial Destruction of the Skin.The epidermis and papilla are destroyed in patches, leaving hard, dry, and insensitive sloughs of a yellow or black colour.The pain in these burns is intense, but passes off during the first or second day, to return again, however, when, about the end of a week, the sloughs separate and expose the nerve filaments of the underlying skin.Granulations spring up to fill the gap, and are rapidly covered by epithelium, derived partly from the margins and partly from the remains of skin glands which have not been completely destroyed.These latter appear on the surface of the granulations as small bluish islets which gradually increase in size, become of a greyish-white colour, and ultimately blend with one another and with the edges.The resulting cicatrix may be slightly depressed, but otherwise exhibits little tendency to contract and cause deformity.
describe: X-Rays and Radium|INJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY  Injuries produced by Exposure to X-Rays and Radium.In the routine treatment of disease by radiations, injury is sometimes done to the tissues, even when the greatest care is exercised as to dosage and frequency of application.Robert Knox describes the following ill-effects.Acute dermatitis  varying in degree from a slight erythema to deep ulceration or even necrosis of skin.When ulcers form they are extremely painful and slow to heal.When hair-bearing areas are affected, epilation may occur without destroying the hair follicles and the hairs are reproduced, but if the reaction is excessive permanent alopecia may result.
describe: The Antiseptic System of Surgery|"The Antiseptic System of Surgery.Those who only know the surgical conditions of to-day can scarcely realise the state of matters which existed before the introduction of the antiseptic system by Joseph Lister in 1867.In those days few wounds escaped the ravages of pyogenic and other bacteria, with the result that suppuration ensued after most operations, and such diseases as erysipelas, pyamia, and ""hospital gangrene"" were of everyday occurrence.The mortality after compound fractures, amputations, and many other operations was appalling, and death from blood-poisoning frequently followed even the most trivial operations.An operation was looked upon as a last resource, and the inherent risk from blood-poisoning seemed to have set an impassable barrier to the further progress of surgery.To the genius of Lister we owe it that this barrier was removed."
describe: Chemical Agents|Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.Severe  burns  and  scalds  may be followed by necrosis of tissue.So long as the parts are kept absolutely dry as, for example, by the picric acid method of treatment the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene; but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access, moist gangrene follows.Strong  chemical agents , such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of the lesions produced being like those of severe burns.The resulting sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which are long of healing.Carbolic Gangrene.Sterilisation by Chemical Agents.For the purification of the skin of the patient, the hands of the surgeon, and knives and other instruments that are damaged by heat, recourse must be had to chemical agents.These, however, are less reliable than heat, and are open to certain other objections.Disinfection of the Hands.It is now generally recognised that one of the most likely sources of wound infection is the hands of the surgeon and his assistants.It is only by carefully studying to avoid all contact with infective matter that the hands can be kept surgically pure, and that this source of wound infection can be reduced to a minimum.
describe: Moschcowitz|Moschcowitz has found that the tensile strength of catgut so prepared is increased if it is kept dry in a sterile vessel, instead of being left indefinitely in the iodine solution.If Salkindsohn's formula is used tincture of iodine, 1 part; proof spirit, 15 parts the gut can be kept permanently in the solution without becoming brittle.To avoid contamination from the hands, catgut should be removed from the bottle with aseptic forceps and passed direct to the surgeon.Any portion unused should be thrown away.Silk  is prepared by being soaked for twelve hours in ether, for other twelve in alcohol, and then boiled for ten minutes in 1 in 1000 sublimate solution.It is then wound on spools with purified hands protected by sterilised gloves, and kept in absolute alcohol.
describe: Prevention of Operation Shock|"Prevention of Operation Shock.In the preparation of a patient for operation, drastic purgation and prolonged fasting must be avoided, and about half an hour before a severe operation a pint of saline solution should be slowly introduced into the rectum; this is repeated, if necessary, during the operation, and at its conclusion.The operating-room must be warm not less than 70° F. and the patient should be wrapped in cotton wool and blankets, and surrounded by hot-bottles.All lotions used must be warm (100° F.); and the operation should be completed as speedily and as bloodlessly as possible.The element of fear may to some extent be eliminated by the preliminary administration of such drugs as scopolamin or morphin, and with a view to preventing the passage of exciting afferent impulses, Crile advocates ""blocking"" of the nerves by the injection of a 1 per cent.solution of novocaine into their substance on the proximal side of the field of operation."
describe: DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium|DELIRIUM IN SURGICAL PATIENTS Delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations.It may be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic infective diseases of the urinary organs.In the various forms of meningitis also, and in some cases of injury to the head, it is common; and it is sometimes met with after severe hamorrhage, and in cases of poisoning by such drugs as iodoform, cocain, or alcohol.Delirium may also, of course, be a symptom of insanity.Often there is merely incoherent muttering regarding past incidents or occupations, or about absent friends; or the condition may assume the form of excitement, of dementia, or of melancholia; and the symptoms are usually worst at night.Delirium Tremens  is seen in persons addicted to alcohol, who, as the result of accident or operation, are suddenly compelled to lie in bed.
describe: Entrance of Air into Veins Air Embolism|Entrance of Air into Veins Air Embolism.This serious, though fortunately rare, accident is apt to occur in the course of operations in the region of the thorax, neck, or axilla, if a large vein is opened and fails to collapse on account of the rigidity of its walls, its incorporation in a dense fascia, or from traction being made upon it.If the wound in a vein is thus held open, the negative pressure during inspiration sucks air into the right side of the heart.This is accompanied by a hissing or gurgling sound, and with the next expiration some frothy blood escapes from the wound.The patient instantly becomes pale, the pupils dilate, respiration becomes laboured, and although the heart may continue to beat forcibly, the peripheral pulse is weak, and may even be imperceptible.On auscultating the heart, a churning sound may be heard.
describe: the tunica externa retract|(b) If an artery is only  partly cut across , the divided fibres of the tunica muscularis contract and those of the tunica externa retract, with the result that a more or less circular hole is formed in the wall of the vessel, from which free bleeding takes place, as the conditions are unfavourable for the formation of an occluding clot.Even if a clot does form, when the blood-pressure rises it is readily displaced, leading to reactionary hamorrhage.Should the wound become infected, secondary hamorrhage is specially liable to occur.A further risk attends this form of injury, in that the intra-vascular tension may in time lead to gradual stretching of the scar tissue which closes the gap in the vessel wall, with the result that a localised dilatation or diverticulum forms, constituting a  traumatic aneurysm .(c) When the injury merely takes the form of a  puncture  or  small incision  a blood-clot forms between the edges, becomes organised, and is converted into cicatricial tissue which seals the aperture.Such wounds may also be followed by reactionary or secondary hamorrhage, or later by the formation of a traumatic aneurysm.
describe: Continuity|Repair of a Vessel ligated in its Continuity.When a ligature is applied to an artery it should be pulled sufficiently tight to occlude the lumen without causing rupture of its coats.It often happens, however, that the compression causes rupture of the inner and middle coats, so that only the outer coat remains in the grasp of the ligature.While this weakens the wall of the vessel, it has the advantage of hastening coagulation, by bringing the blood into contact with damaged tissue.Whether the inner and middle coats are ruptured or not, blood coagulates both above and below the ligature, the proximal clot being longer and broader than that on the distal side.In small arteries these clots extend as far as the nearest collateral branch, but in the larger trunks their length varies.
describe: Repair of Veins|Repair of Veins.The process of repair in veins is the same as that in arteries, but the thrombosed area may become canalised and the circulation through the vessel be re-established.HAMORRHAGE IN SURGICAL OPERATIONS The management of the hamorrhage which accompanies an operation includes (a) preventive measures, and (b) the arrest of the bleeding.Prevention of Hamorrhage.Whenever possible, hamorrhage should be controlled by  digital compression  of the main artery supplying the limb rather than by a tourniquet.If efficiently applied compression reduces the immediate loss of blood to a minimum, and the bleeding from small vessels that follows the removal of the tourniquet is avoided.
describe: Hamostatics|Hamostatics  or  Styptics .The local application of hamostatics is seldom to be recommended.In the treatment of epistaxis or bleeding from the nose, of hamorrhage from the socket of a tooth, and sometimes from ulcerating or granulating surfaces, however, they may be useful.All clots must be removed and the drug applied directly to the bleeding surface.Adrenalin and turpentine are the most useful drugs for this purpose.Hamorrhage from bone, for example the skull, may be arrested by means of Horsley's aseptic plastic wax.
describe: hamatemesis|In severe cases, and especially when the vomited matter resembles coffee-grounds from admixture with altered blood the so-called post-operative hamatemesis the best means of arresting the vomiting is by washing out the stomach.Thirst is relieved by rectal injections of saline solution.The introduction of saline solution into the veins or by the rectum is also useful in diluting and hastening the elimination of circulating toxins.In surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the temperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed.When severe or prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold sponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of drugs.Relief of Symptoms.The coughing up of blood from the lungs is known as  hamoptysis ; vomiting of blood from the stomach, as  hamatemesis ; the passage of black-coloured stools due to the presence of blood altered by digestion, as  melana ; and the passage of bloody urine, as  hamaturia .Hamorrhage is known as arterial, venous, or capillary, according to the nature of the vessel from which it takes place.In  arterial  hamorrhage the blood is bright red in colour, and escapes from the cardiac end of the divided vessel in pulsating jets synchronously with the systole of the heart.In vascular parts for example the face both ends of a divided artery bleed freely.The blood flowing from an artery may be dark in colour if the respiration is impeded.When the heart's action is weak and the blood tension low the flow may appear to be continuous and not in jets.
describe: hamophilia|It is well to remember that those who suffer from scurvy, or hamophilia (bleeders), and fat and anamic females, are liable to be bruised by comparatively trivial injuries.Clinical Features.The less severe forms of contusion are associated with  ecchymosis , numerous minute and discrete punctate hamorrhages being scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is slightly œdematous.The effused blood is soon reabsorbed.The more severe forms are attended with  extravasation , the extravasated blood being widely diffused through the cellular tissue of the part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of the orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest wall.A blue or bluish-black discoloration occurs in patches, varying in size and depth with the degree of force which produced the injury, and in shape with the instrument employed.This form of bleeding is serious in those who are the subjects of hamophilia.INJURIES OF ARTERIES The following description of the injuries of arteries refers to the larger, named trunks.The injuries of smaller, unnamed vessels are included in the consideration of wounds and contusions.Contusion.An artery may be contused by a blow or crush, or by the oblique impact of a bullet.The bruising of the vessel wall, especially if it is diseased, may result in the formation of a thrombus which occludes the lumen temporarily or even permanently, and in rare cases may lead to gangrene of the limb beyond.
describe: Hamorrhage|"Hamorrhage  from erosion of arterial or venous trunks may take place and endanger life.Treatment.The treatment of diffuse cellulitis depends to a large extent on the situation and extent of the affected area, and on the stage of the process.In the limbs , for example, where the application of a constricting band is practicable, Bier's method of inducing passive hyperamia yields excellent results.If pus is formed, one or more small incisions are made and a light moist dressing placed over the wounds to absorb the discharge, but no drain is inserted.The whole of the inflamed area should be covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 in 10 solution of ichthyol in glycerine.Hamorrhage is easily controlled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be dispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere with the vitality of the flaps.When the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be justifiable, if the patient urgently desires it, to amputate lower than the knee; but there is considerable risk of gangrene recurring in the stump and necessitating a second operation.That amputation for senile gangrene performed between the ankle and the knee seldom succeeds, is explained by the fact that the vascular obstruction is usually in the upper part of the posterior tibial artery, and the operation is therefore performed through tissues with an inadequate blood supply.It is not uncommon, indeed, on amputating above the knee, to find even the popliteal artery plugged by a clot.This should be removed at the amputation by squeezing the vessel from above downward by a ""milking"" movement, or by ""catheterising the artery"" with the aid of a cannula with a terminal aperture.It is to be borne in mind that the object of amputation in these cases is merely to remove the gangrenous part, and so relieve the patient of the discomfort and the risks from infection which its presence involves."
describe: The cutaneous navus|"The cutaneous navus , ""mother's mark,"" or ""port-wine stain,"" consists of an aggregation of dilated capillaries in the substance of the skin.On stretching the skin the vessels can be seen to form a fine network, or to run in leashes parallel to one another.A dilated arteriole or a vein winding about among the capillaries may sometimes be detected.These navi occur on any part of the body, but they are most frequently met with on the face.They may be multiple, and vary greatly in size, some being no bigger than a pin-head, while others cover large areas of the body.In colour they present every tint from purple to brilliant red; in the majority there is a considerable dash of blue, especially in cold weather."
describe: Mixed Navus|Mixed Navus.As its name indicates, the mixed navus partakes of the characters of the other two varieties; that is, it is a subcutaneous navus with involvement of the skin.It is frequently met with on the face and head, but may occur on any part of the body.It also affects parts covered by mucous membrane, such as the cheek, tongue, and soft palate.The swelling is rounded or lobulated, and projects beyond the level of its surroundings.Sometimes the skin is invaded by the navoid tissue over the whole extent of the tumour, sometimes only over a limited area.
describe: the mixed navus|As its name indicates, the mixed navus partakes of the characters of the other two varieties; that is, it is a subcutaneous navus with involvement of the skin.It is frequently met with on the face and head, but may occur on any part of the body.It also affects parts covered by mucous membrane, such as the cheek, tongue, and soft palate.The swelling is rounded or lobulated, and projects beyond the level of its surroundings.Sometimes the skin is invaded by the navoid tissue over the whole extent of the tumour, sometimes only over a limited area.Frequently the margin only is of a bright-red colour, while the skin in the centre resembles a cicatrix.
describe: narrowings|The affected vessels slowly increase in size, and become tortuous, with narrowings and dilatations here and there.Grooves and gutters are frequently found in the bone underlying the dilated vessels.There is a constant loud bruit in the tumour, which greatly troubles the patient and may interfere with sleep.There is no tendency either to natural cure or to rupture, but severe and even fatal hamorrhage may follow a wound of the dilated vessels.The condition may be treated by excision or by electrolysis.In excision the hamorrhage is controlled by an elastic tourniquet applied horizontally round the head, or by ligation of the feeding trunks.
describe: Extirpation|Extirpation of the Sac The Old Operation.The procedure which goes by this name consists in exposing the aneurysm, incising the sac, clearing out the clots, and ligating the artery above and below the sac.This method is suitable to sacculated aneurysm of the limbs, so long as they are circumscribed and free from complications.It has been successfully practised also in aneurysm of the subclavian, carotid, and external iliac arteries.It is not applicable to cases in which there is such a degree of atheroma as would interfere with the successful ligation of the artery.The continuity of the artery may be restored by grafting into the gap left after excision of the sac a segment of the great saphena vein.Extirpation of the sac is probably the best method of treatment, especially in those of traumatic origin.These operations are attended with considerable risk of hemiplegia from interference with the blood supply of the brain.The  external carotid  and the cervical portion of the  internal carotid  are seldom the primary seat of aneurysm, although they are liable to be implicated by the upward spread of an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the common trunk.In addition to the ordinary signs of aneurysm, the clinical manifestations are chiefly referable to pressure on the pharynx and larynx, and on the hypoglossal nerve.Aneurysm of the internal carotid is of special importance on account of the way in which it bulges into the pharynx in the region of the tonsil, in some cases closely simulating a tonsillar abscess.Cases are on record in which such an aneurysm has been mistaken for an abscess and incised, with disastrous results.
describe: the Sac The Old Operation|Extirpation of the Sac The Old Operation.The procedure which goes by this name consists in exposing the aneurysm, incising the sac, clearing out the clots, and ligating the artery above and below the sac.This method is suitable to sacculated aneurysm of the limbs, so long as they are circumscribed and free from complications.It has been successfully practised also in aneurysm of the subclavian, carotid, and external iliac arteries.It is not applicable to cases in which there is such a degree of atheroma as would interfere with the successful ligation of the artery.The continuity of the artery may be restored by grafting into the gap left after excision of the sac a segment of the great saphena vein.
describe: Distal Ligation|"Distal Ligation.The tying of the artery beyond the sac, or of its two branches where it bifurcates (Brasdor, 1760, and Wardrop, 1825), may arrest or only diminish the flow of blood through the sac.It is less successful than the proximal ligature, and is therefore restricted to aneurysms so situated as not to be amenable to other methods; for example, in aneurysm of the common carotid near its origin, the artery may be ligated near its bifurcation, or in aneurysm of the innominate artery, the carotid and subclavian arteries are tied at the seat of election.Compression.Digital compression of the feeding artery has been given up except as a preparation for operations on the sac with a view to favouring the development of a collateral circulation.Macewen's acupuncture or ""needling""  consists in passing one or more fine, highly tempered steel needles through the tissues overlying the aneurysm, and through its outer wall."
describe: white gelatin|solution of white gelatin in normal salt solution being injected at a temperature of about 100° F.; the injection of pituitary extract.The application of a pad of gauze soaked in the blood of a normal person sometimes arrests the bleeding.To prevent bleeding in hamophilics, intra-venous or subcutaneous injections of fresh blood serum, taken from the human subject, the sheep, the dog, or the horse, have proved useful.If fresh serum is not available, anti-diphtheritic or anti-tetanic serum or trade preparations, such as hemoplastin, may be employed.We have removed the appendix and amputated through the thigh in hamophilic subjects without excessive loss of blood after a course of fresh sheep's serum given by the mouth over a period of several weeks.The chloride and lactate of calcium, and extract of thymus gland have been employed to increase the coagulability of the blood.solution of white gelatin in sterilised water, at a temperature of about 100° F., are injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen every two, three, or four days.In the course of a fortnight or three weeks improvement may begin.The clot which forms is liable to soften and be absorbed, but a repetition of the injection has in several cases established a permanent cure.Amputation of the limb  is indicated in cases complicated by suppuration, by secondary hamorrhage after excision or ligation, or by gangrene.Amputation at the shoulder was performed by Fergusson in a case of subclavian aneurysm, as a means of arresting the blood-flow through the sac.TRAUMATIC ANEURYSM The essential feature of a traumatic aneurysm is that it is produced by some form of injury which divides all the coats of the artery.
describe: Innominate|Innominate aneurysm  may be of the fusiform or of the sacculated variety, and is frequently associated with pouching of the aorta.It usually grows upwards and laterally, projecting above the sternum and right clavicle, which may be eroded or displaced (Fig.75).Symptoms of pressure on the structures in the neck, similar to those produced by aortic aneurysm, occur.The pulses in the right upper extremity and in the right carotid and its branches are diminished and delayed.Pressure on the right brachial plexus causes shooting pain down the arm and muscular paresis on that side.
describe: Orbital Aneurysm|Orbital Aneurysm.The term pulsating exophthalmos is employed to embrace a number of pathological conditions, including aneurysm, in which the chief symptoms are pulsation in the orbit and protrusion of the eyeball.There may be, in addition, congestion and œdema of the eyelids, and a distinct thrill and murmur, which can be controlled by compression of the common carotid in the neck.Varying degrees of ocular paralysis and of interference with vision may also be present.These symptoms are due, in the majority of cases, to an aneurysmal varix of the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus, which is often traumatic in origin, being produced either by fracture of the base of the skull or by a punctured wound of the orbit.In other cases they are due to aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery, to thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and, in rare instances, to cirsoid aneurysm.

describe: Femoral Arteries|Inguinal Aneurysm  ( Aneurysm of the Iliac and Femoral Arteries ).Aneurysms appearing in the region of Poupart's ligament may have their origin in the external or common iliac arteries or in the upper part of the femoral.On account of the tension of the fascia lata, they tend to spread upwards towards the abdomen, and, to a less extent, downwards into the thigh.Sometimes a constriction occurs across the sac at the level of Poupart's ligament.The pressure exerted on the nerves and veins of the lower extremity causes pain, congestion, and œdema of the limb.Rupture may take place externally, or into the cellular tissue of the iliac fossa.
describe: Surgical Anatomy and Physiology|Surgical Anatomy and Physiology.Lymph is essentially blood plasma, which has passed through the walls of capillaries.After bathing and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct.These lymph vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood vessels  perivascular lymph vessels .They have a structure similar to that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves.Along the course of the lymph trunks are the  lymph glands , which possess a definite capsule and are composed of a reticulated connective tissue, the spaces of which are packed with leucocytes.
describe: glandula concatinata|The sterno-mastoid glands  glandula concatinata form a chain along the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, some of them lying beneath the muscle.They are commonly enlarged in secondary syphilis.The superior deep cervical (internal jugular) glands  from six to twenty in number form a continuous chain along the internal jugular vein, beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle.They drain the various groups of glands which lie nearer the surface, also the interior of the skull, the larynx, trachea, thyreoid, and lower part of the pharynx, and pour their lymph into the main trunks at the root of the neck.Belonging to this group is one large gland (the tonsillar gland) which lies behind the posterior belly of the digastric, and rests in the angle between the internal jugular and common facial veins.It is commonly enlarged in affections of the tonsil and posterior part of the tongue.
describe: anticus major muscle|The retro-pharyngeal glands  lie on each side of the median line upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle and in front of the pre-vertebral layer of the cervical fascia.They receive part of the lymph from the posterior wall of the pharynx, the interior of the nose and its accessory cavities, the auditory (Eustachian) tube, and the tympanum.When they are infected with pyogenic organisms or with tubercle bacilli, they may lead to the formation of one form of retro-pharyngeal abscess.Upper Extremity.The epi-trochlear and cubital glands  vary in number, that most commonly present lying about an inch and a half above the medial epi-condyle, and other and smaller glands may lie along the medial (internal) bicipital groove or at the bend of the elbow.They drain the ulnar side of the hand and forearm, and pour their lymph into the axillary group.
describe: chyle  chylorrhœa|The injury may, however, not be observed at the time of operation, but later through the dressings being soaked with chyle  chylorrhœa .If the wound involves the only existing main duct and all the chyle escapes, the patient suffers from intense thirst, emaciation, and weakness, and may die of inanition; but if, as is usually the case, only one of several collateral channels is implicated, the loss of chyle may be of little moment, as the discharge usually ceases.If the wound heals so that the chyle is prevented from escaping, a fluctuating swelling may form beneath the scar; in course of time it gradually disappears.An attempt should be made to close the wound in the duct by means of a fine suture; failing this, the duct must be occluded by a ligature as if it were a bleeding artery.The tissues are then stitched over it and the skin wound accurately closed, so as to obtain primary union, firm pressure being applied by dressings and an elastic webbing bandage.Even if the main duct is obliterated, a collateral circulation is usually established.
describe: Lymphangiectasis|Lymphangiectasis  is a dilated or varicose condition of lymph vessels.It is met with as a congenital affection in the tongue and lips, or it may be acquired as the result of any condition which is attended with extensive obliteration or blocking of the main lymph trunks.An interesting type of lymphangiectasis is that which results from the presence of the  filaria Bancrofti  in the vessels, and is observed chiefly in the groin, spermatic cord, and scrotum of persons who have lived in the tropics.Filarial disease in the lymphatics of the groin  appears as a soft, doughy swelling, varying in size from a walnut to a cocoa-nut; it may partly disappear on pressure and when the patient lies down.The patient gives a history of feverish attacks of the nature of lymphangitis during which the swelling becomes painful and tender.These attacks may show a remarkable periodicity, and each may be followed by an increase in the size of the swelling, which may extend along the inguinal canal into the abdomen, or down the spermatic cord into the scrotum.
describe: lymphangiectasis|Apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with as the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels ( lymphangiectasis ); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known example is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.GANGLION This term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or colloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.The commonest variety the  carpal ganglion  popularly known as a sprained sinew is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig.60).It is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this region, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.The skin and fascia are movable over the cyst.An interesting type of lymphangiectasis is that which results from the presence of the  filaria Bancrofti  in the vessels, and is observed chiefly in the groin, spermatic cord, and scrotum of persons who have lived in the tropics.Filarial disease in the lymphatics of the groin  appears as a soft, doughy swelling, varying in size from a walnut to a cocoa-nut; it may partly disappear on pressure and when the patient lies down.The patient gives a history of feverish attacks of the nature of lymphangitis during which the swelling becomes painful and tender.These attacks may show a remarkable periodicity, and each may be followed by an increase in the size of the swelling, which may extend along the inguinal canal into the abdomen, or down the spermatic cord into the scrotum.On dissection, the swelling is found to be made up of dilated, tortuous, and thickened lymph vessels in which the parent worm is sometimes found, and of greatly enlarged lymph glands which have undergone fibrosis, with giant-cell formation and eosinophile aggregations.The fluid in the dilated vessels is either clear or turbid, in the latter case resembling chyle.
describe: Lymphangioma|Lymphangioma.A lymphangioma is a swelling composed of a series of cavities and channels filled with lymph and freely communicating with one another.The cavities result either from the new formation of lymph spaces or vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist; their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue lined by endothelium and strengthened by non-striped muscle.They are rarely provided with a definite capsule, and frequently send prolongations of their substance between and into muscles and other structures in their vicinity.They are of congenital origin and usually make their appearance at or shortly after birth.When the tumour is made up of a meshwork of caverns and channels, it is called a  cavernous lymphangioma ; when it is composed of one or more cysts, it is called a  cystic lymphangioma .Lymphangiomas are met with in the abdomen in the form of  omental cysts .DISEASES OF LYMPH GLANDS  Lymphadenitis.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa.
describe: lymphangio|The  periosteal lipoma  is usually congenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a projecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles an angioma or a lymphangioma.The  subserous lipoma  arises from the extra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it tends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give rise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal fat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial openings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a  fatty hernia .A  subsynovial lipoma  grows from the fat surrounding the synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving rise to the symptoms of loose body.Lipomas are also met with growing from the adipose connective tissue  between or in the substance of muscles , and, when situated beneath the deep fascia, such as the fascia lata of the thigh, the characteristic signs are obscured and a differential diagnosis is difficult.It may be differentiated from a cold abscess by puncture with an exploring needle.Zanthoma  is a rare but interesting form of tumour, composed of a fibrous and fatty tissue, containing a granular orange-yellow pigment, resembling that of the corpus luteum.Angioma ,  lymphangioma , and  neuroma  are described with the disease of the individual tissues.MALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS SARCOMA The term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which exhibits malignant characters.The essential structural feature is the predominance of the cellular elements over the intercellular substance or stroma, in which respect a sarcoma resembles the connective tissue of the embryo.The typical sarcoma consists chiefly of immature or embryonic connective tissue.It most frequently originates from fascia, intermuscular connective tissue, periosteum, bone-marrow, and skin, and forms a rounded or nodulated tumour which appears to be encapsulated, but the capsule merely consists of the condensed surrounding tissues, and usually contains sarcomatous elements.The consistence of the tumour depends on the nature and amount of the stroma, and on the presence of degenerative changes.
describe: Lymphangiomas|Lymphangiomas are met with in the abdomen in the form of  omental cysts .DISEASES OF LYMPH GLANDS  Lymphadenitis.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa.
describe: Lymphadenitis|DISEASES OF LYMPH GLANDS  Lymphadenitis.Inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the afferent lymph vessels.These vessels may share in the inflammation and be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage of the noxa.It is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland through the blood-stream.A strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent infection such as gonorrhœa.It is possible for gonococci to lie latent in the inguinal glands for long periods, and only give rise to lymphadenitis if the glands be subsequently subjected to injury.
describe: Tuberculous Disease of Glands|Tuberculous Disease of Glands.This is a disease of great frequency and importance.The tubercle bacilli usually gain access to the gland through the afferent lymph vessels, which convey them from some lesion of the surface within the area drained by them.Tuberculous infection may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic septic irritation.While any of the glands in the body may be affected, the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.The appearance of the glands on section  varies with the stage of the disease.
describe: Syphilitic Disease of Glands|Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Enlargement of lymph glands is a prominent feature of acquired syphilis, especially in the form of the indolent or bullet-bubo which accompanies the primary lesion, and the general enlargement of glands that occurs in secondary syphilis.Gummatous disease in glands is extremely rare; the affected gland rapidly enlarges to the size of a walnut, and may then persist for a long period without further change; if it breaks down, the overlying skin is destroyed and the caseated tissue of the gumma exposed.Lymphadenoma.Hodgkin's Disease  (Pseudo-leukamia of German authors).This is a rare disease, the origin of which is as yet unknown, but analogy would suggest that it is due to infection with a slowly growing micro-organism.
describe: leucocythamia|The enlargement associated with leucocythamia is differentiated by the characteristic changes in the blood.Treatment.In the acute form of lymphadenoma, treatment is of little avail.Arsenic may be given in full doses either by the mouth or by subcutaneous injection; the intravenous administration of neo-salvarsan may be tried.Exposure to the X-rays and to radium has been more successful than any other form of treatment.Excision of glands, although sometimes beneficial, seldom arrests the progress of the disease.
describe: Leucocythamia|Leucocythamia.This is a disease of the blood and of the blood-forming organs, in which there is a great increase in the number, and an alteration of the character, of the leucocytes present in the blood.It may simulate lymphadenoma, because, in certain forms of the disease, the lymph glands, especially those in the neck, axilla, and groin, are greatly enlarged.TUMOURS OF LYMPH GLANDS  Primary Tumours.Lympho-sarcoma , which may be regarded as a sarcoma starting in a lymph gland, appears in the neck, axilla, or groin as a rapidly growing tumour consisting of one enlarged gland with numerous satellites.As the tumour increases in size, the sarcomatous tissue erupts through the capsule of the gland, and infiltrates the surrounding tissues, whereby it becomes fixed to these and to the skin.
describe: Complete Division|Complete Division of a Mixed Nerve.Complete division is a common result of accidental wounds, especially above the wrist, where the ulnar, median, and radial nerves are frequently cut across, and in gun-shot injuries.Changes in Structure and Function.The mere interruption of the continuity of a nerve results in degeneration of its fibres, the myelin being broken up into droplets and absorbed, while the axis cylinders swell up, disintegrate, and finally disappear.Both the conducting and the insulating elements are thus lost.The degeneration in the central end of the divided nerve is usually limited to the immediate proximity of the lesion, and does not even involve all the nerve fibres.
describe: Process of Repair|Modifications of the Process of Repair.The process of repair by primary union, above described, is to be looked upon as the type of all reparative processes, such modifications as are met with depending merely upon incidental differences in the conditions present, such as loss of tissue, infection by micro-organisms, etc.Repair after Loss or Destruction of Tissue.When the edges of a wound cannot be approximated either because tissue has been lost, for example in excising a tumour or because a drainage tube or gauze packing has been necessary, a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to fill the gap, but the process is essentially the same as in the ideal method of repair.The raw surface is first covered by a layer of coagulated blood and fibrin.An extensive new formation of capillary loops and fibroblasts takes place towards the free surface, and goes on until the gap is filled by a fine velvet-like mass of granulation tissue.Process of Repair when the Ends are in Contact.If the wound is aseptic , and the ends of the divided nerve are sutured or remain in contact, they become united, and the conducting paths are re-established by a regeneration of nerve fibres.There is a difference of opinion as to the method of regeneration.The Wallerian doctrine is that the axis cylinders in the central end grow downwards, and enter the nerve sheaths of the distal portion, and continue growing until they reach the peripheral terminations in muscle and skin, and in course of time acquire a myelin sheath; the cells of the neurolemma multiply and form long chains in both ends of the nerve, and are believed to provide for the nourishment and support of the actively lengthening axis cylinders.Another view is that the formation of new axis cylinders is not confined to the central end, but that it goes on also in the peripheral segment, in which, however, the new axis cylinders do not attain maturity until continuity with the central end has been re-established.If the wound becomes infected  and suppuration occurs, the young nerve fibres are destroyed and efficient regeneration is prevented; the formation of scar tissue also may constitute a permanent obstacle to new nerve fibres bridging the gap.
describe: Sensory Phenomena|Sensory Phenomena.Superficial touch is tested by means of a wisp of cotton wool stroked gently across the skin; the capacity of discriminating two points as separate, by a pair of blunt-pointed compasses; the sensation of pressure, by means of a pencil or other blunt object; of pain, by pricking or scratching with a needle; and of sensibility to heat and cold, by test-tubes containing water at different temperatures.While these tests are being carried out, the patient's eyes are screened off.After division of a nerve containing sensory fibres, there is an area of absolute cutaneous insensibility to touch (anasthesia), to pain (analgesia), and to all degrees of temperature  loss of protopathic sensibility ; surrounded by an area in which there is loss of sensation to light touch, inability to recognise minor differences of temperature (72°–104° F.), and to appreciate as separate impressions the contact of the two points of a compass  loss of epicritic sensibility  (Head and Sherren) (Figs.91, 92).Motor Phenomena.
describe: Motor Phenomena|Motor Phenomena.There is immediate and complete loss of voluntary power in the muscles supplied by the divided nerve.The muscles rapidly waste, and within from three to five days, they cease to react to the faradic current.When tested with the galvanic current, it is found that a stronger current must be used to call forth contraction than in a healthy muscle, and the contraction appears first at the closing of the circuit when the anode is used as the testing electrode.The loss of excitability to the interrupted current, and the specific alteration in the type of contraction with the constant current, is known as the  reaction of degeneration .After a few weeks all electric excitability is lost.
describe: Arthropathies|Arthropathies are occasionally met with, the joints becoming the seat of a painless effusion or hydrops, which is followed by fibrous thickening of the capsular and other ligaments, and terminates in stiffness and fibrous ankylosis.In this way the fingers are seriously crippled and deformed.Treatment of Divided Nerves.The treatment consists in approximating the divided ends of the nerve and placing them under the most favourable conditions for repair, and this should be done at the earliest possible opportunity.( Op.Surg.
describe: Incomplete Division of a Mixed Nerve|Incomplete Division of a Mixed Nerve.The effects of partial division of a mixed nerve vary according to the destination of the nerve bundles that have been interrupted.Within their area of distribution the paralysis is as complete as if the whole trunk had been cut across.The uninjured nerve-bundles continue to transmit impulses with the result that there is a  dissociated paralysis  within the distribution of the affected nerve, some muscles continuing to act and to respond normally to electric stimulation, while others behave as if the whole nerve-trunk had been severed.In addition to vasomotor and trophic changes, there is often severe pain of a burning kind ( causalgia  or  thermalgia ) which comes on about a fortnight after the injury and causes intense and continuous suffering which may last for months.Paroxysms of pain may be excited by the slightest touch or by heat, and the patient usually learns for himself that the constant application of cold wet cloths allays the pain.
describe: hyperasthesia|One of the most constant symptoms is the early occurrence of severe neuralgic pain, and this is usually associated with marked hyperasthesia.Regeneration.Process of Repair when the Ends are in Contact.If the wound is aseptic , and the ends of the divided nerve are sutured or remain in contact, they become united, and the conducting paths are re-established by a regeneration of nerve fibres.There is a difference of opinion as to the method of regeneration.The Wallerian doctrine is that the axis cylinders in the central end grow downwards, and enter the nerve sheaths of the distal portion, and continue growing until they reach the peripheral terminations in muscle and skin, and in course of time acquire a myelin sheath; the cells of the neurolemma multiply and form long chains in both ends of the nerve, and are believed to provide for the nourishment and support of the actively lengthening axis cylinders.Some weeks or months after the injury, the patient complains of increasing hyperasthesia and of neuralgic pains in the course of the nerve.The nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and, if superficial, may be felt to be swollen.The associated muscles are wasted and weak, and are subject to twitchings.There are also trophic disturbances.It is rare to have complete sensory and motor paralysis.The disease is commonest in the nerves of the upper extremity, and the hand may become crippled and useless.
describe: Multiple Peripheral Neuritis|Multiple Peripheral Neuritis.Although this disease mainly comes under the cognizance of the physician, it may be attended with phenomena which call for surgical interference.In this country it is commonly due to alcoholism, but it may result from diabetes or from chronic poisoning with lead or arsenic, or from bacterial infections and intoxications such as occur in diphtheria, gonorrhœa, syphilis, leprosy, typhoid, influenza, beri-beri, and many other diseases.It is, as a rule, widely distributed throughout the peripheral nerves, but the distribution frequently varies with the cause the alcoholic form, for example, mainly affecting the legs, the diphtheritic form the soft palate and pharynx, and that associated with lead poisoning the forearms.The essential lesion is a degeneration of the conducting fibres of the affected nerves, and the prominent symptoms are the result of this.In alcoholic neuritis there is great tenderness of the muscles.
describe: the ulnar nerve|This injury, which resembles the dislocation of tendons from their grooves, is seldom met with except in the ulnar nerve at the elbow, and is described with injuries of that nerve.DISEASES OF NERVES  Traumatic Neuritis.This consists in an overgrowth of the connective-tissue framework of a nerve, which causes irritation and pressure upon the nerve fibres, sometimes resulting in their degeneration.It may originate in connection with a wound in the vicinity of a nerve, as, for example, when the brachial nerves are involved in scar tissue subsequent to an operation for clearing out the axilla for cancer; or in contusion and compression of a nerve for example, by the pressure of the head of the humerus in a dislocation of the shoulder.Some weeks or months after the injury, the patient complains of increasing hyperasthesia and of neuralgic pains in the course of the nerve.The nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and, if superficial, may be felt to be swollen.Infra-clavicular injuries , as already stated, are most often produced by a sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus; the medial cord is that most frequently injured, and the muscles paralysed are those supplied by the ulnar nerve, with, in addition, those intrinsic muscles of the hand supplied by the median.Sensibility is affected over the medial surface of the forearm and ulnar area of the hand.Injury of the lateral and posterior cords is very rare.Treatment  is carried out on the lines already laid down for nerve injuries in general.It is impossible to diagnose between complete and incomplete rupture of the nerve cords, until sufficient time has elapsed to allow of the establishment of the reaction of degeneration.If this is present at the end of fourteen days, operation should not be delayed.
describe: ossis metacarpi|The palmaris longus is anastomosed with the abductor pollicis longus (extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis), thus securing a fair amount of abduction of the thumb.The flexor carpi ulnaris may also be anastomosed with the common extensor of the fingers.The extensors of the wrist may be shortened, so as to place the hand in the position of dorsal flexion, and thus improve the attitude and grasp of the hand.The superficial branch of the radial  (radial nerve)  and the deep branch  (posterior interosseous), apart from suffering in lesions of the radial, are liable to be contused or torn is dislocation of the head of the radius, and in fracture of the neck of the bone.The deep branch may be divided as it passes through the supinator in operations on old fractures and dislocations in the region of the elbow.Division of the superficial branch in the upper two-thirds of the forearm produces no loss of sensibility; division in the lower third after the nerve has become associated with branches from the musculo-cutaneous is followed by a loss of sensibility on the radial side of the hand and thumb.ossis metacarpi pollicis), while opposition may be simulated by contraction of the long flexor and the short abductor of the thumb; the paralysis of the two medial lumbricals produces no symptoms that can be recognised.It is important to remember that when the median nerve is divided at the wrist, deep touch can be appreciated over the whole of the area supplied by the nerve; the injury, therefore, is liable to be over looked.If, however, the tendons are divided as well as the nerve, there is insensibility to deep touch.The areas of epicritic and of protopathic insensibility are illustrated in Fig.91.The division of the nerve at the elbow, or even at the axilla, does not increase the extent of the loss of epicritic or protopathic sensibility, but usually affects deep sensibility.
describe: The Ulnar Nerve|The Ulnar Nerve.The most common injury of this nerve is its division in transverse accidental wounds just above the wrist.In the arm it may be contused, along with the radial, in crutch paralysis; in the region of the elbow it may be injured in fractures or dislocations, or it may be accidentally divided in the operation for excising the elbow-joint.When it is injured  at or above the elbow , there is paralysis of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus, all the interossei, the two medial lumbricals, and the adductors of the thumb.The hand assumes a characteristic attitude: the index and middle fingers are extended at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints owing to paralysis of the interosseous muscles attached to them; the little and ring fingers are hyper-extended at these joints in consequence of the paralysis of the lumbricals; all the fingers are flexed at the inter-phalangeal joints, the flexion being most marked in the little and ring fingers claw-hand or  main en griffe .On flexing the wrist, the hand is tilted to the radial side, but the paralysis of the flexor carpi ulnaris is often compensated for by the action of the palmaris longus.
describe: cubitus valgus|Dislocation of the ulnar nerve  at the elbow results from sudden and violent flexion of the joint, the muscular effort causing stretching or laceration of the fascia that holds the nerve in its groove; it is predisposed to if the groove is shallow as a result of imperfect development of the medial condyle of the humerus, and by cubitus valgus.The nerve slips forward, and may be felt lying on the medial aspect of the condyle.It may retain this position, or it may slip backwards and forwards with the movements of the arm.The symptoms at the time of the displacement are some disability at the elbow, and pain and tingling along the nerve, which are exaggerated by movement and by pressure.The symptoms may subside altogether, or a neuritis may develop, with severe pain shooting up the nerve.The dislocated nerve is easily replaced, but is difficult to retain in position.
describe: The Sciatic Nerve|"The Sciatic Nerve.When this nerve is compressed, as by sitting on a fence, there is tingling and powerlessness in the limb as a whole, known as ""sleeping"" of the limb, but these phenomena are evanescent.Injuries to the great sciatic nerve  are rare except in war.Partial division is more common than complete, and it is noteworthy that the fibres destined for the peroneal nerve are more often and more severely injured than those for the tibial (internal popliteal).After complete division, all the muscles of the leg are paralysed; if the section is in the upper part of the thigh, the hamstrings are also paralysed.The limb is at first quite powerless, but the patient usually recovers sufficiently to be able to walk with a little support, and although the hamstrings are paralysed the knee can be flexed by the sartorius and gracilis."
describe: The Common Peroneal|"The Common Peroneal (external popliteal) nerve  is exposed to injury where it winds round the neck of the fibula, because it is superficial and lies against the unyielding bone.It may be compressed by a tourniquet, or it may be bruised or torn in fractures of the upper end of the bone.It has been divided in accidental wounds, by a scythe, for example, in incising for cellulitis, and in performing subcutaneous tenotomy of the biceps tendon.Cases have been observed of paralysis of the nerve as a result of prolonged acute flexion of the knee in certain occupations.When the nerve is divided, the most obvious result is ""drop-foot""; the patient is unable to dorsiflex the foot and cannot lift his toes off the ground, so that in walking he is obliged to jerk the foot forwards and laterally.The loss of sensibility depends upon whether the nerve is divided above or below the origin of the large cutaneous branch which comes off just before it passes round the neck of the fibula."
describe: The Injection of Alcohol|The Injection of Alcohol into the Nerve.The alcohol acts by destroying the nerve fibres, and must be brought into direct contact with them; if the nerve has been properly struck the injection is followed by complete anasthesia in the distribution of the nerve.The relief may last for from six months to three years; if the pain returns, the injection may be repeated.The strength of the alcohol should be 85 per cent., and the amount injected about 2 c.c.; a general, or preferably a local, anasthetic (novocain) should be employed (Schlösser); the needle is 8 cm.long, and 0.7 mm.
describe: novocain-suprarenin|solution of  novocain-suprarenin  through it before the alcohol is injected.The treatment by injection of alcohol is superior to the resection of branches of the nerve, for though relapses occur after the treatment with alcohol, renewed freedom from pain may be obtained by its repetition.The ophthalmic division should not, however, be treated in this manner, for the alcohol may escape into the orbit and endanger other nerves in this region.Harris recommends the injection of alcohol into the semilunar ganglion.Operative Treatment.This consists in the removal of the affected nerve or nerves, either by resection  neurectomy ; or by a combination of resection with twisting or tearing of the nerve from its central connections  avulsion .
describe: Callosities|Callosities  are prominent, indurated masses of the horny layer of the epidermis, where it has been exposed to prolonged friction and pressure.They occur on the fingers and hand as a result of certain occupations and sports, but are most common under the balls of the toes or heel.A bursa may form beneath a callosity, and if it becomes inflamed may cause considerable suffering; if suppuration ensues, a sinus may form, resembling a perforating ulcer of the foot.The  treatment  of callosities on the foot consists in removing pressure by wearing properly fitting boots, and in applying a ring pad around the callosity; another method is to fit a sock of spongiopilene with a hole cut out opposite the callosity.After soaking in hot water, the overgrown horny layer is pared away, and the part painted daily with a saturated solution of salicylic acid in flexile collodion.Corns.
describe: Boils and Carbuncles|"Boils and Carbuncles.These result from infection with the staphylococcus aureus, which enters the orifices of the ducts of the skin under the influence of friction and pressure, as was demonstrated by the well-known experiment of Garrè, who produced a crop of pustules and boils on his own forearm by rubbing in a culture of the staphylococcus aureus.A  boil  results when the infection is located in a hair follicle or sebaceous gland.A hard, painful, conical swelling develops, to which, so long as the skin retains its normal appearance, the term ""blind boil"" is applied.Usually, however, the skin becomes red, and after a time breaks, giving exit to a drop or two of thick pus.After an interval of from six to ten days a soft white slough is discharged; this is known as the ""core,"" and consists of the necrosed hair follicle or sebaceous gland."
describe: ceous gland|The more highly organised elements of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands, are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and hairless.Epithelium.Epithelium is only reproduced from pre-existing epithelium, and, as a rule, from one of a similar type, although metaplastic transformation of cells of one kind of epithelium into another kind can take place.Thus a granulating surface may be covered entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins; or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw area.Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of loose epithelial cells from the edges.Even the fluid from a blister, in virtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface.Thus a granulating surface may be covered entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins; or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw area.Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of loose epithelial cells from the edges.Even the fluid from a blister, in virtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface.Hairs and nails may be completely regenerated if a sufficient amount of the hair follicles or of the nail matrix has escaped destruction.The epithelium of a mucous membrane is regenerated in the same way as that on a cutaneous surface.Epithelial cells have the power of living for some time after being separated from their normal surroundings, and of growing again when once more placed in favourable circumstances.
describe: inoculation tubercle|We have chiefly observed it in the femoral glands as a result of inoculation tubercle on the toes or sole of the foot.The affected glands nearly always break down and suppurate, and after destroying the overlying skin give rise to fungating ulcers.The treatment consists in excising the glands and the affected skin.The dissection may be attended with troublesome hamorrhage from the numerous veins that converge towards the femoral trunk.Tuberculous disease in the  mesenteric  and  bronchial glands  is described with the surgery of regions.Syphilitic Disease of Glands.Interest attaches chiefly to the primary forms of tuberculosis of the skin in which the bacilli penetrate from without inoculation tubercle and lupus.Inoculation Tubercle.The appearances vary with the conditions under which the inoculation takes place.As observed on the fingers of adults, the affection takes the form of an indolent painless swelling, the epidermis being red and glazed, or warty, and irregularly fissured.Sometimes the epidermis gives way, forming an ulcer with flabby granulations.The infection rarely spreads to the lymphatics, but we have seen inoculation tubercle of the index-finger followed by a large cold abscess on the median side of the upper arm and by a huge mass of breaking down glands in the axilla.

describe: Sporotrichosis|Sporotrichosis  is a mycotic infection due to the sporothrix Shenkii.It presents so many features resembling syphilis and tubercle that it is frequently mistaken for one or other of these affections.It occurs chiefly in males between fifteen and forty-five, who are farmers, fruit and vegetable dealers, or florists.There is usually a history of trauma of the nature of a scratch or a cut, and after a long incubation period there develop a series of small, hard, round nodules in the skin and subcutaneous tissue which, without pain or temperature, soften into cold abscesses and leave indolent ulcers or sinuses.The infection is of slow progress and follows the course of the lymphatics.From the gelatinous pus the organism is cultivated without difficulty, and this is the essential step in arriving at a diagnosis.
describe: lymphangioplasty|Handley has devised a method of treatment  lymphangioplasty  the object of which is to drain the lymph by embedding a number of silk threads in the subcutaneous cellular tissue.Wounds of the Thoracic Duct.The thoracic duct usually opens at the angle formed by the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins, but it may open into either of these vessels by one or by several channels, or the duct may be double throughout its course.There is a smaller duct on the right side the right lymphatic duct.The duct or ducts may be displaced by a tumour or a mass of enlarged glands, and may be accidentally wounded in dissections at the root of the neck; jets of milky fluid chyle may at once escape from it.The jets are rhythmical and coincide with expiration.Samson Handley has sought to replace the blocked lymph vessels by burying in the subcutaneous tissue of the swollen part a number of stout silk threads  lymphangioplasty .By their capillary action they drain the lymph to a healthy region above, and thus enable it to enter the circulation.It has been more successful in the face and upper limb than in the lower extremity.If the tissues are infected with pus organisms, a course of vaccines should precede the operation.A similar type of elephantiasis may occur after extirpation of the lymph glands in the axilla or groin; in the leg in long-standing standing varix and phlebitis with chronic ulcer; in the arm as a result of extensive cancerous disease of the lymphatics in the axilla secondarily to cancer of the breast; and in extensive tuberculous disease of the lymphatics.The last-named is chiefly observed in the lower limb in young adult women, and from its following upon lupus of the toes or foot it has been called  lupus elephantiasis .
describe: Hutchinson|Erratic chancre is the term applied by Jonathan Hutchinson to the primary lesion of syphilis when it appears on parts of the body other than the genitals.It differs in some respects from the hard chancre as met with on the penis; it is usually larger, the induration is more diffused, and the enlarged glands are softer and more sensitive.The glands in nearest relation to the sore are those first affected, for example, the epitrochlear or axillary glands in chancre of the finger; the submaxillary glands in chancre of the lip or mouth; or the pre-auricular gland in chancre of the eyelid or forehead.In consequence of their divergence from the typical chancre, and of their being often met with in persons who, from age, surroundings, or moral character, are unlikely subjects of venereal disease, the true nature of erratic chancres is often overlooked until the persistence of the lesion, its want of resemblance to anything else, or the onset of constitutional symptoms, determines the diagnosis of syphilis.A solitary, indolent sore occurring on the lip, eyelid, finger, or nipple, which does not heal but tends to increase in size, and is associated with induration and enlargement of the adjacent glands, is most likely to be the primary lesion of syphilis. ]From  A System of Syphilis , vol.After the dying away of the secondary manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the patient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called  reminders .These usually consist of relapses of certain of the affections of the skin, mouth, or throat, already described.In the skin, they may assume the form of peeling patches in the palms, or may appear as spreading and confluent circles of a scaly papular eruption, which if neglected may lead to the formation of fissures and superficial ulcers.Less frequently there is a relapse of the eye affections, or of paralytic symptoms from disease of the cerebral arteries.Tertiary Syphilis.While the manifestations of primary and secondary syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.
describe: crateriform|A more exuberant and rapidly growing form of epithelial cancer, described by Hutchinson as the  crateriform ulcer , commences on the face as a small red pimple which rapidly develops into an elevated mass shaped like a bee-hive, and breaks down in the centre.Epithelioma may develop anywhere on the body in relation to long-standing ulcers, especially that resulting from a burn or from lupus; this form usually presents an exuberant outgrowth of epidermis not unlike a cauliflower.An interesting example of epithelioma has been described by Neve of Kashmir.The natives in that province are in the habit of carrying a fire-basket suspended from the waist, which often burns the skin and causes a chronic ulcer, and many of these ulcers become the seat of epithelioma, due, in Neve's opinion, to the actual contact of the sooty pan with the skin.The term  trade epithelioma  has been applied to that form met with in those who follow certain occupations, such as paraffin workers and chimney-sweeps.The most recent member of this group is the  X-ray carcinoma , which is met with in those who are constantly exposed to the irritation of the X-rays; there is first a chronic dermatitis with warty overgrowth of the surface epithelium, pigmentation, and the formation of fissures and warts.

describe: Sprain and Partial Rupture of Muscle|"Sprain and Partial Rupture of Muscle.This lesion consists in overstretching and partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle or its aponeurosis.It is of common occurrence in athletes and in those who follow laborious occupations.It may follow upon a single or repeated effort especially in those who are out of training.Familiar examples of muscular sprain are the ""labourer's"" or ""golfer's back,"" affecting the latissimus dorsi or the sacrospinalis (erector spina); the ""tennis-player's elbow,"" and the ""sculler's sprain,"" affecting the muscles and ligaments about the elbow; the ""angler's elbow,"" affecting the common origin of the extensors and supinators; the ""sprinter's sprain,"" affecting the flexors of the hip; and the ""jumper's and dancer's sprain,"" affecting the muscles of the calf.The patient complains of pain, often sudden in onset, of tenderness on pressure, and of inability to carry out the particular movement by which the sprain was produced."
describe: the ulnar border|The prominence of the tendon, which normally forms the ulnar border of the snuff-box, disappears.This lesion is chiefly met with in drummer-boys and is the cause of drummer's palsy.The only chance of restoring function is in uniting the ruptured tendon by open operation.Avulsion of Tendons.This is a rare injury, in which the tendons of a finger or toe are torn from their attachments along with a portion of the digit concerned.In the hand, it is usually brought about by the fingers being caught in the reins of a runaway horse, or being seized in a horse's teeth, or in machinery.
describe: aponeuroses|"It would appear to involve mainly the fibrous tissue of muscles, although it may extend from this to aponeuroses, ligaments, periosteum, and the sheaths of nerves.The term  fibrositis  was applied to it by Gowers in 1904.In  lumbago   lumbo-sacral fibrositis  the pain is usually located over the sacrum, the sacro-iliac joint, or the aponeurosis of the lumbar muscles on one or both sides.The amount of tenderness varies, and so long as the patient is still he is free from pain.The slightest attempt to alter his position, however, is attended by pain, which may be so severe as to render him helpless for the moment.The pain is most marked on rising from the stooping or sitting posture, and may extend down the back of the hip, especially if, as is commonly the case, lumbago and gluteal fibrosis coexist.A similar condition may implicate the fascia lata of the thigh, or the calf muscles and their aponeuroses  crural fibrositis .In  painful stiff-neck , or ""rheumatic torticollis,"" the pain is located in one side of the neck, and is excited by some inadvertent movement.The head is held stiffly on one side as in wry-neck, the patient contracting the sterno-mastoid.There may be tenderness over the vertebral spines or in the lines of the cervical nerves, and the sterno-mastoid may undergo atrophy.This affection is more often met with in children.In  pleurodynia   intercostal fibrositis  the pain is in the line of the intercostal nerves, and is excited by movement of the chest, as in coughing, or by any bodily exertion."
describe: Llewellyn and Jones|"If untreated, the morbid process may implicate the sheath of the sciatic nerve and cause genuine sciatic neuralgia (Llewellyn and Jones).A similar condition may implicate the fascia lata of the thigh, or the calf muscles and their aponeuroses  crural fibrositis .In  painful stiff-neck , or ""rheumatic torticollis,"" the pain is located in one side of the neck, and is excited by some inadvertent movement.The head is held stiffly on one side as in wry-neck, the patient contracting the sterno-mastoid.There may be tenderness over the vertebral spines or in the lines of the cervical nerves, and the sterno-mastoid may undergo atrophy.This affection is more often met with in children."

describe: latissimus|"Familiar examples of muscular sprain are the ""labourer's"" or ""golfer's back,"" affecting the latissimus dorsi or the sacrospinalis (erector spina); the ""tennis-player's elbow,"" and the ""sculler's sprain,"" affecting the muscles and ligaments about the elbow; the ""angler's elbow,"" affecting the common origin of the extensors and supinators; the ""sprinter's sprain,"" affecting the flexors of the hip; and the ""jumper's and dancer's sprain,"" affecting the muscles of the calf.The patient complains of pain, often sudden in onset, of tenderness on pressure, and of inability to carry out the particular movement by which the sprain was produced.The disability varies in different cases, and it may incapacitate the patient from following his occupation or sport for weeks or, if imperfectly treated, even for months.The  treatment  consists in resting the muscle from the particular effort concerned in the production of the sprain, in gently exercising it in other directions, in the use of massage, and the induction of hyperamia by means of heat.In neglected cases, that is, where the muscle has not been exercised, the patient shrinks from using it and the disablement threatens to be permanent; it is sometimes said that adhesions have formed and that these interfere with the recovery of function.The condition may be overcome by graduated movements or by a sudden forcible movement under an anasthetic.The muscles of the back, especially the trapezius and latissimus, are the first to be affected, and the initial complaint is limitation of movement.The affected muscles show swellings which are rounded or oval, firm and elastic, sharply defined, without tenderness and without discoloration of the overlying skin.Skiagrams show that a considerable deposit of lime salts may precede the formation of bone, as is seen in Fig.111.In course of time the vertebral column becomes rigid, the head is bent forward, the hips are flexed, and abduction and other movements of the arms are limited.The disease progresses by fits and starts, until all the striped muscles of the body are replaced by bone, and all movements, even those of the jaws, are abolished."
describe: Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths|Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths.These closely resemble the syphilitic affections of the synovial membrane of joints.During the secondary period the lesion usually consists in effusion into the sheath; gummata are met with during the tertiary period.Arborescent lipoma has been found in the sheaths of tendons about the wrist and ankle, sometimes in a multiple and symmetrical form, unattended by symptoms and disappearing under anti-syphilitic treatment.Tumours of Tendon Sheaths.Innocent tumours, such as  lipoma ,  fibroma , and  myxoma , are rare.
describe: ligamentum|"The bursa  between the ligamentum patella and the tibia  is rarely the seat of disease.When it is, there is pain and tenderness referred to the ligament, the patient is unable to extend the limb completely, the tuberosity of the tibia is apparently enlarged, and there is a fluctuating swelling on either side of the ligament, most marked in the extended position of the limb.Of the numerous bursa in the popliteal space, that  between the semi-membranosus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius  is most frequently the seat of disease, which is usually of the nature of a simple hydrops, forming a fluctuating egg-or sausage-shaped swelling at the medial side of the popliteal space.It is flaccid in the flexed, and tense in the extended position.As a rule it causes little inconvenience, and may be left alone.Otherwise it should be dissected out, and if, as is frequently the case, there is a communication with the knee-joint, this should be closed with sutures.Intra-articular ligaments, such as the ligamentum teres in the hip, are usually worn away and disappear.The surrounding muscles undergo atrophy, tendons become adherent to their sheaths and may be ossified, and the sheaths of nerves may be involved by the cicatricial changes in the surrounding tissues.The X-ray appearances of arthritis deformans  necessarily vary with the type of the disease and the joint affected; in the joints of the fingers there is a narrowing of the spaces between the articular ends of the bones as a result of absorption of the articular cartilage, and rarefaction of the cancellous tissue in the vicinity of the joints; in the larger joints there is ""lipping"" of the articular margins, osteophytes, and other evidence of abnormal ossification in and around the joint.Eburnation of the articular surfaces is shown by increase in the density of the shadow of the bone in the areas affected.Treatment.Treatment is for the most part limited to the relief of symptoms."
describe: gastrocnemius|"As examples may be cited the rupture of the quadriceps extensor in attempting to regain the balance when falling backwards; of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, or tendo-calcaneus in jumping or dancing; of the adductors of the thigh in gripping a horse when it swerves ""rider's sprain""; of the abdominal muscles in vomiting, and of the biceps in sudden movements of the arm.Sometimes the effort is one that would scarcely be thought likely to rupture a muscle, as in the case recorded by Pagenstecher, where a professional athlete, while sitting at table, ruptured his biceps in a sudden effort to catch a falling glass.It would appear that the rupture is brought about not so much by the contraction of the muscle concerned, as by the contraction of the antagonistic muscles taking place before that of the muscle which undergoes rupture is completed.The violent muscular contractions of epilepsy, tetanus, or delirium rarely cause rupture.The  clinical features  are usually characteristic.The patient experiences a sudden pain, with the sensation of being struck with a whip, and of something giving way; sometimes a distant snap is heard.We have observed this form of tuberculous disease in the gastrocnemius and in the psoas in the latter muscle apart from tuberculous disease in the vertebra.Tendinitis.German authors describe an inflammation of tendon as distinguished from inflammation of its sheath, and give it the name tendinitis.It is met with most frequently in the tendo-calcaneus in gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon, especially during cold and damp weather.There is localised pain which is aggravated by walking, and the tendon is sensitive and swollen from a little above its insertion to its junction with the muscle.Gouty nodules may form in its substance."
describe: the subcalcanean bursa|"The bursa that is sometimes met with on the under aspect of the calcaneus  the subcalcanean bursa  when inflamed, gives rise to pain and tenderness in the sole of the foot.This affection may be associated with a spinous projection from the bone, which is capable of being recognised in a skiagram.The soft parts of the heel are turned forwards as a flap, the bursa is dissected out, and the projection of bone, if present, is removed.The enlargement of adventitious bursa over the head of the first metatarsal in hallux valgus; over the tarsus, metatarsus, and digits in the different forms of club-foot; over the angular projection in Pott's disease of the spine; over the end of the bone in amputation stumps, and over hard tumours such as chondroma and osteoma, are described elsewhere.CHAPTER XX DISEASES OF BONE

Anatomy and physiology Regeneration of bone Transplantation of bone.DISEASES OF BONE Definition of terms Pyogenic diseases:      Acute osteomyelitis and periostitis ;  Chronic and relapsing     osteomyelitis ;  Abscess of bone  Tuberculous disease Syphilitic     disease Hydatids; Rickets; Osteomalacia Ostitis deformans of     Paget Osteomyelitis fibrosa Affections of bones in diseases of     the nervous system Fragilitas ossium Tumours and cysts of bone."

describe: EAM  Diseases|INFECTIONS THROUGH THE BLOOD-STREAM  Diseases caused by the Staphylococcus Aureus.As the majority of pyogenic diseases are due to infection with the staphylococcus aureus, these will be described first.Acute osteomyelitis  is a suppurative process beginning in the marrow and tending to spread to the periosteum.The disease is common in children, but is rare after the skeleton has attained maturity.Boys are affected more often than girls, in the proportion of three to one, probably because they are more liable to exposure, to injury, and to violent exertion.Etiology.

describe: Staphylococci|Staphylococci gain access to the blood-stream in various ways, it may be through the skin or through a mucous surface.Such conditions as, for example, a blow, some extra exertion such as a long walk, or exposure to cold, as in wading, may act as localising factors.The long bones are chiefly affected, and the commonest sites are: either end of the tibia and the lower end of the femur; the other bones of the skeleton are affected in rare instances.Pathology.The disease commences and is most intense in the marrow of the ossifying junction at one end of the diaphysis; it may commence at both ends simultaneously  bipolar osteomyelitis ; or, commencing at one end, may spread to the other.The changes observed are those of intense engorgement of the marrow, going on to greenish-yellow purulent infiltration.
describe: General Complications|General Complications.In some cases a  multiplicity of lesions  in the bones and joints imparts to the disease the features of pyamia.The occurrence of endocarditis, as indicated by alterations in the heart sounds and the development of murmurs, may cause widespread infective embolism, and metastatic suppurations in the kidneys, heart-wall, and lungs, as well as in other bones and joints than those primarily affected.The secondary suppurations are liable to be overlooked unless sought for, as they are rarely attended with much pain.In these multiple forms of osteomyelitis the toxamic symptoms predominate; the patient is dull and listless, or he may be restless and talkative, or actually delirious.The tongue is dry and coated, the lips and teeth are covered with sordes, the motions are loose and offensive, and may be passed involuntarily.
describe: Sequela of Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis|Sequela of Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis.The commonest sequel is the presence of a sequestrum with one or more discharging sinuses; owing to the abundant formation of scar tissue these sinuses have rigid edges which are usually depressed and adherent to the bone.The Recognition and Removal of Sequestra.So long as there is dead bone there will be suppuration from the granulations lining the cavity in which it lies, and a discharge of pus from the sinuses, so that the mere persistence of discharge after an attack of osteomyelitis, is presumptive evidence of the occurrence of necrosis.Where there are one or more sinuses, the passage of a probe which strikes bare bone affords corroboration of the view that the bone has perished.When the dead bone has been separated from the living, the X-rays yield the most exact information.

describe: Circumscribed Abscess|"Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.In the initial stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present.Increased elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and suppuration.An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative process is spreading.The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess.When it is situated superficially for example, in the breast tissue the affected area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the surface.Circumscribed Abscess of Bone ""Brodie's Abscess.""The most important form of relapsing osteomyelitis is the circumscribed abscess of bone first described by Benjamin Brodie.It is usually met with in young adults, but we have met with it in patients over fifty.Several years may intervene between the original attack of osteomyelitis and the onset of symptoms of abscess.Morbid Anatomy.The abscess is nearly always situated in the central axis of the bone in the region of the ossifying junction, although cases are occasionally met with in which it lies nearer the middle of the shaft."
describe: un-united fract|There still remain those forms of osteomyelitis which result from infection through a wound involving the bone for example, compound fractures, gun-shot injuries, osteotomies, amputations, resections, or operations for un-united fracture.In all of these the marrow is exposed to infection by such organisms as are present in the wound.A similar form of osteomyelitis may occur apart from a wound for example, infection may spread to the jaws from lesions of the mouth; to the skull, from lesions of the scalp or of the cranial bones themselves such as a syphilitic gumma or a sarcoma which has fungated externally; or to the petrous temporal, from suppuration in the middle ear.The most common is an osteomyelitis commencing in the marrow exposed in a wound infected with pyogenic organisms.In amputation stumps, fungating granulations protrude from the sawn end of the bone, and if necrosis takes place, the sequestrum is annular, affecting the cross-section of the bone at the saw-line; or tubular, extending up the shaft, and tapering off above.The periosteum is more easily detached, is thicker than normal, and is actively engaged in forming bone.
describe: the tubercle bacil|There is evidence that a  mixed infection  that is, the introduction of more than one species of organism, for example, the tubercle bacillus and a pyogenic staphylococcus increases the severity of the resulting disease.If one of the varieties gain the ascendancy, the poisons produced by the others so devitalise the tissue cells, and diminish their power of resistance, that the virulence of the most active organisms is increased.On the other hand, there is reason to believe that the products of certain organisms antagonise one another for example, an attack of erysipelas may effect the cure of a patch of tuberculous lupus.Lastly, in patients suffering from chronic wasting diseases, bacteria may invade the internal organs by the blood-stream in enormous numbers and with great rapidity, during the period of extreme debility which shortly precedes death.The discovery of such collections of organisms on post-mortem examination may lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn as to the cause of death.Results of Bacterial Growth.Others, on the contrary for example, the tubercle bacillus and the organism of acute osteomyelitis although frequently remaining localised at the seat of inoculation, tend to pass to distant parts, lodging in the capillaries of joints, bones, kidney, or lungs, and there producing their deleterious effects.In the human subject, multiplication in the blood-stream does not occur to any great extent.In some general acute pyogenic infections, such as osteomyelitis, cellulitis, etc., pure cultures of staphylococci or of streptococci may be obtained from the blood.In pneumococcal and typhoid infections, also, the organisms may be found in the blood.It is by the vital changes they bring about in the parts where they settle that micro-organisms disturb the health of the patient.In deriving nourishment from the complex organic compounds in which they nourish, the organisms evolve, probably by means of a ferment, certain chemical products of unknown composition, but probably colloidal in nature, and known as  toxins .
describe: dactylitis|"Gummatous disease is frequently observed also in the flat bones of the skull, in the bones of the hand, as syphilitic dactylitis, and in the bones of the forearm and leg.When the tibia is affected the disease is frequently bilateral, and may assume the form of gummatous ulcers and sinuses.In later years the tibia may present alterations in shape resulting from antecedent gummatous disease for example, nodular thickenings of the shaft, flattening of the crest, or a more uniform increase in thickness and length of the shaft of the bone, which, when it is curved in addition, is described as the ""sabre-blade"" deformity.Among lesions of the viscera, mention should be made of gumma of the testis, which causes the organ to become enlarged, uneven, and indurated.This has even been observed in infants a few months old.Occasionally a syphilitic child suffers from a succession of these gummatous lesions with resulting ill-health, and, it may be, waxy disease of the internal organs; on the other hand, it may recover and present no further manifestations of the inherited taint.When growing in the interior of a bone it causes a spindle-shaped enlargement of the shaft, which in the case of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble the dactylitis resulting from tubercle or syphilis.A chondroma appears as a clear area in a skiagram.A  skiagram  of a bone in which there is a chondroma shows a clear rounded area in the position of the tumour, which must be differentiated from similar clear areas due to other kinds of tumour, especially the myeloma; when it has undergone calcification or ossification, it gives a shadow as dark as bone.Treatment.In view of the unstable quality of the chondroma, especially of its liability to become malignant, it should be removed as soon as it is recognised.In those projecting from the surface of a bone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed."
describe: Evanescent|Evanescent periostitis  is met with in acquired syphilis during the period of the early skin eruptions.The patient complains, especially at night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibia, or ulna.Localised tenderness is elicited on pressure, and there is slight swelling, which, however, rarely amounts to what may be described as a  periosteal node .In the later stages of acquired syphilis,  gummatous periostitis and osteomyelitis  occur, and are characterised by the formation in the periosteum and marrow of circumscribed gummata or of a diffuse gummatous infiltration.The framework of the bone is rarefied in the area immediately involved, and sclerosed in the parts beyond.If the gummatous tissue degenerates and breaks down, and especially if the overlying skin is perforated and septic infection is superadded, the bone disintegrates and exhibits the condition known as  syphilitic caries ; sometimes a portion of bone has its blood supply so far interfered with that it dies  syphilitic necrosis .
describe: Jacksonian|On the inner surface of the skull, the formation of gummatous tissue may cause pressure on the brain and give rise to intense pain in the head, Jacksonian epilepsy, or paralysis, the symptoms varying with the seat and extent of the disease.The cranial nerves may be pressed upon at the base, especially at their points of exit, and this gives rise to symptoms of irritation or paralysis in the area of distribution of the nerves affected.In the septum of the nose, the nasal bones, and the hard palate , gummatous disease causes ulceration, which, beginning in the mucous membrane, spreads to the bones, and being complicated with septic infection leads to caries and necrosis.In the nose, the disease is attended with stinking discharge (ozœna), the extrusion of portions of dead bone, and subsequently with deformity characterised by loss of the bridge of the nose; in the palate, it is common to have a perforation, so that the air escapes through the nose in speaking, giving to the voice a characteristic nasal tone.Syphilitic disease of the tibia  may be taken as the type of the affection as it occurs  in the long bones .Gummatous disease in the periosteum may be localised and result in the formation of a well-defined node, or the whole shaft may become the seat of an irregular nodular enlargement (Fig.
describe: Craniotabes|Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.In the majority of cases the child recovers from these early manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an indefinite period of good health.On the other hand, when it attains the age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.Later Lesions.In the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the later manifestations may take the form of localised gummata, which tend to break down and form ulcers, on the leg for example, or of a spreading gummatous infiltration which is also liable to ulcerate, leaving disfiguring scars, especially on the face.Craniotabes , in which the flat bones of the skull undergo absorption in patches, was formerly regarded as syphilitic, but it is now known to result from prolonged malnutrition from any cause.Bossing of the skull  resulting in the formation of Parrot's nodes is also being withdrawn from the category of syphilitic affections.The lesions in infancy epiphysitis, bossing of the skull, and craniotabes have been referred to in the chapter on inherited syphilis.Epiphysitis or Syphilitic Perichondritis.The first of these terms is misleading, because the lesion involves the ossifying junction and the shaft of the bone, and the epiphysis only indirectly.The young bone is replaced by granulation tissue, so that large clear areas are seen with the X-rays.
describe: craniotabes|"The conditions of the skull known as Parrot's nodes or bosses, and craniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited syphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety children, from other causes.The  bosses  result from the heaping up of new spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped symmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either side of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove the ""natiform skull.""The bosses disappear in time, but the skull may remain permanently altered in shape, the frontal and parietal eminences appearing unduly prominent.The term  craniotabes  is applied when the bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow.Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.The term  craniotabes  is applied when the bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow.Craniotabes is recovered from as the child improves in health.Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be met with, such as  effusion into the joints , especially the knees;  iritis , in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.In the majority of cases the child recovers from these early manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an indefinite period of good health.On the other hand, when it attains the age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.Later Lesions."
describe: fragilitas|CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES ATTENDED WITH LESIONS IN THE BONES These include rickets, scurvy-rickets, osteomalacia, ostitis deformans, osteomyelitis fibrosa, fragilitas ossium, and diseases of the nervous system.RICKETS Rickets or rachitis is a constitutional disease associated with disturbance of nutrition, and attended with changes in the skeleton.The disease is most common and most severe among the children of the poorer classes in large cities, who are improperly fed and are brought up in unhealthy surroundings.There is evidence that the most important factors in the causation of rickets are ill-health of the mother during pregnancy, and the administration to the child after its birth of food which is defective in animal fat, proteids, and salts of lime, or which contains these in such a form that they are not readily assimilated.The occurrence of the disease is favoured, and its features are aggravated, by imperfect oxygenation of the blood as the result of a deficiency of fresh air and sunlight, want of exercise, and by other conditions which prevail in the slums of large towns.Pathological Anatomy.
describe: Rachitis Adolescentium  |Late Rickets  or  Rachitis Adolescentium  is met with at any age from nine to seventeen, and is generally believed to be due to a recrudescence of rickets which had been present in childhood.The disease is not attended with any disturbance of the general health; the pathological changes are the same as in infantile rickets, but are for the most part confined to the ossifying junctions, especially those which are most active during adolescence, for example at the knee-joint.The patient is easily tired, complains of pain in the bones, and, unless care is taken, deformity is liable to ensue.There can be no doubt that adolescent rickets plays an important part in the production of the deformities which occur at or near puberty, especially knock-knee and bow-knee.Scurvy-Rickets  or  Infantile Scurvy .This disease, described by Barlow and Cheadle, is met with in infants under two years who have been brought up upon sterilised or condensed milk and other proprietary foods, and is most common in the well-to-do classes.
describe: Hamorrhages|Hamorrhages also occur into the skin, presenting the appearance of bruises, into the orbit and conjunctiva, and from the mucous membranes.The  treatment  consists in correcting the errors in diet.The infant should have a wet nurse or a plentiful supply of cow's milk in its natural state.Anti-scorbutics in the form of orange, lemon, or grape juice, and of potatoes bruised down in milk, may be given.Osteomalacia.The term osteomalacia includes a group of conditions, closely allied to rickets, in which the bones of adults become soft and yielding, so that they are unduly liable to bend or break.
describe: conjunctiva|Grafts of  mucous membrane  are used to cover defects in the lip, cheek, and conjunctiva.The technique is similar to that employed in skin-grafting; the sources of mucous membrane are limited and the element of septic infection cannot always be excluded.Fat.Adipose tissue has a low vitality, but it is easily retained and it readily lends itself to transplantation.Portions of fat are often obtainable at operations from the omentum, for example, otherwise the subcutaneous fat of the buttock is the most accessible; it may be employed to fill up cavities of all kinds in order to obtain more rapid and sounder healing and also to remedy deformity, as in filling up a depression in the cheek or forehead.It is ultimately converted into ordinary connective tissue  pari passu  with the absorption of the fat.The conjunctiva also may be yellow.In the latter stages of the disease the pulse becomes small and fluttering; the tongue becomes dry and brown; sordes collect on the teeth; and a low muttering form of delirium supervenes.Secondary infection of the parotid gland frequently occurs, and gives rise to a suppurative parotitis.This condition is associated with severe pain, gradually extending from behind the angle of the jaw on to the face.There is also swelling over the gland, and eventually suppuration and sloughing of the gland tissue and overlying skin.Secondary abscesses in the lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or joints are often so insidious and painless in their development that they are only discovered accidentally.
describe: New Growths|New Growths in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue.The  Angioma  has been described with diseases of blood vessels.Fibroma.Various types of fibroma occur in the skin.A soft pedunculated fibroma, about the size of a pea, is commonly met with, especially on the neck and trunk; it is usually solitary, and is easily removed with scissors.The multiple, soft fibroma known as  molluscum fibrosum , which depends upon a neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves, is described with the tumours of nerves.Osteomalacia associated with New Growths in the Skeleton.When  secondary cancer  is widely distributed throughout the skeleton, it is associated with softening of the bones, as a result of which they readily bend or break, and after death are easily cut with a knife.In the disease known as  multiple myeloma , the interior of the ribs, sternum, and bodies of the vertebra is occupied by a reddish gelatinous pulp, the structure of which resembles sarcoma; the bones are reduced to a mere shell, and may break on the slightest pressure; the urine contains albumose, a substance resembling albumen but coagulating at a comparatively low temperature (140° F.), and the coagulum is re-dissolved on boiling, and it is readily precipitated by hydrochloric acid (Bence-Jones).Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.
describe: Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone|Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.In course of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance; it is at first devoid of lime salts, but later becomes calcified, so that the bones regain their rigidity.This formation of new bone is much in excess of the normal, the bones become large and bulky, their surfaces rough and uneven, their texture sclerosed in parts, and the medullary canal is frequently obliterated.These changes are well brought out in X-ray photographs.
describe: Fragilitas Ossium|Osteogenesis Imperfecta ,  Fragilitas Ossium , or  Congenital Osteopsathyrosis .These terms are used to describe a condition in which an undue fragility of the bones dates from intra-uterine life.It may occur in several members of the same family.In severe cases, intra-uterine fractures occur, and during parturition fresh fractures are almost sure to be produced, so that at birth there is a combination of recent fractures and old fractures united and partly united, with bendings and thickenings of the bones.Large areas of the cranial vault may remain membranous.After birth the predisposition to fracture continues, the bones are easily broken, the fractures are attended with little or no pain, the crepitus is soft, and although union may take place, it may be delayed and be attended with excess of callus.
describe: Periosteal|"Periosteal tuberculosis  is met with in the ribs, sternum, vertebral column, skull, and less frequently in the long bones of the limbs.It may originate in the periosteum, or may spread thence from the marrow, or from synovial membrane.In superficial bones , such as the sternum, the formation of tuberculous granulation tissue in the deeper layer of the periosteum, and its subsequent caseation and liquefaction, is attended by the insidious development of a doughy swelling, which is not as a rule painful, although tender on pressure.While the swelling often remains quiescent for some time, it tends to increase in size, to become boggy or fluctuating, and to assume the characters of a cold abscess.The pus perforates the fibrous layer of the periosteum, invading and infecting the overlying soft parts, its spread being influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues.The size of the abscess affords no indication of the extent of the bone lesion from which it originates.Periosteal tumours  are at first situated on one side of the bone, but as they grow they tend to surround it completely.Innocent periosteal tumours retain the outer fibrous layer as a capsule.Malignant tumours tend to perforate the periosteal capsule and invade the soft parts.Central  or  medullary tumours  as they increase in size replace the surrounding bone, and simultaneously new bone is formed on the surface; as this is in its turn absorbed, further bone is formed beneath the periosteum, so that in time the bone is increased in girth, and is said to be ""expanded"" by the growth in its interior.Primary Tumours Osteoma.When the tumour projects from the surface of a bone it is called an  exostosis ."
describe: Multiple Exostoses|Multiple Exostoses.This disease, which, by custom, is still placed in the category of tumours, is to be regarded as a disorder of growth, dating from intra-uterine life and probably due to a disturbance in the function of the glands of internal secretion, the thyreoid being the one which is most likely to be at fault (Arthur Keith).The disorder of growth is confined to those elements of the skeleton where a core of bone formed in cartilage comes to be encased in a sheath of bone formed beneath the periosteum.To indicate this abnormality the name  diaphysial aclasis  has been employed by Arthur Keith at the suggestion of Morley Roberts.Bones formed entirely in cartilage are exempt, namely, the tarsal and carpal bones, the epiphyses of the long bones, the sternum, and the bodies of the vertebra.Bones formed entirely in membrane, that is, those of the face and of the cranial vault, are also exempt.
describe: Morley Roberts|To indicate this abnormality the name  diaphysial aclasis  has been employed by Arthur Keith at the suggestion of Morley Roberts.Bones formed entirely in cartilage are exempt, namely, the tarsal and carpal bones, the epiphyses of the long bones, the sternum, and the bodies of the vertebra.Bones formed entirely in membrane, that is, those of the face and of the cranial vault, are also exempt.The disorder mainly affects the ossifying junctions of the long bones of the extremities, the vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border of the ilium.Clinically  the disease is attended with the gradual and painless development during childhood or adolescence of a number of tumours or irregular projections of bone, at the ends of the long bones, the vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border of the ilium.They exhibit a rough symmetry; they rarely attain any size; and they usually cease growing when the skeleton attains maturity the conversion of cartilage into bone being then completed.
describe: leontiasis ossea|This rare affection was described by Virchow, and named leontiasis ossea because of the disfigurement to which it gives rise.It usually commences in adolescence as a diffuse overgrowth first of one and then of both maxilla; these bones are enlarged in all directions and project on the face, and the nasal fossa and the maxillary and frontal sinuses become filled up with bone, which encroaches also on the orbital cavities.In addition to the hideous deformity, the patient suffers from blocking of the nose, loss of smell, and protrusion of the eyes, sometimes followed by loss of sight.The condition is liable to spread to the zygomatic and frontal bones, the vault of the skull, and to the mandible.The base of the skull is not affected.The disease is of slow progress and may become arrested; life may be prolonged for many years, or may be terminated by brain complications or by intercurrent affections.
describe: Bence-Jones|In the disease known as  multiple myeloma , the interior of the ribs, sternum, and bodies of the vertebra is occupied by a reddish gelatinous pulp, the structure of which resembles sarcoma; the bones are reduced to a mere shell, and may break on the slightest pressure; the urine contains albumose, a substance resembling albumen but coagulating at a comparatively low temperature (140° F.), and the coagulum is re-dissolved on boiling, and it is readily precipitated by hydrochloric acid (Bence-Jones).Ostitis Deformans Paget's Disease of Bone.This rare disease was first described by Sir James Paget in 1877.In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia.In course of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance; it is at first devoid of lime salts, but later becomes calcified, so that the bones regain their rigidity.This formation of new bone is much in excess of the normal, the bones become large and bulky, their surfaces rough and uneven, their texture sclerosed in parts, and the medullary canal is frequently obliterated.The coexistence of diffuse myelomatosis of the skeleton and albumosuria (Bence-Jones) is referred to on p. 474.Myeloma occurs in the jaws, taking origin in the marrow or from the periosteum of the alveolar process, and is described elsewhere.Sarcoma  and  endothelioma  are the commonest tumours of bone, and present wide variations in structure and in clinical features.Structurally, two main groups may be differentiated: (1) the soft, rapidly growing cellular tumours, and (2) those containing fully formed fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.(1) The  soft cellular tumours  are composed mainly of spindle or round cells; they grow from the marrow of the spongy ends or from the periosteum of the long bones, the diploë of the skull, the pelvis, vertebra, and jaws.As they grow they may cause little alteration in the contour of the bone, but they eat away its framework and replace it, so that the continuity of the bone is maintained only by tumour tissue, and pathological fracture is a frequent result.
describe: Skiagraphy|"Skiagraphy is also of assistance in recognising the vessel involved.Tumours of the thyreoid, enlarged lymph glands, and fatty and sarcomatous tumours can usually be distinguished from aneurysm by the history of the swelling and by physical examination.Cystic tumours and abscesses in the neck are sometimes more difficult to differentiate on account of the apparently expansile character of the pulsation transmitted to them.The fact that compression of the vessel does not affect the size and tension of these fluid swellings is useful in distinguishing them from aneurysm.Treatment.Digital compression of the vessel against the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra the ""carotid tubercle"" has been successfully employed in the treatment of aneurysm near the bifurcation.Skiagraphy is not only of assistance in differentiating new growths from other diseases of bone, but may also yield information as to the situation and nature of the tumour, which may have important bearings on its treatment by operation.When fracture of a long bone takes place in an adolescent or young adult from comparatively slight violence, disease of the bone should be suspected and an X-ray examination made.In difficult cases the final appeal is to exploratory incision and microscopical examination of a portion of the tumour; this should be done when the major operation has been arranged for, the surgeon waiting until the examination is completed.The  prognosis  varies widely.In general, it may be said that periosteal tumours are less favourable than central ones, because they are more liable to give rise to metastases.Permanent cures are unfortunately the exception."
describe: Metastatic Tumours|Metastatic Tumours.Excepting certain cancers which give rise to metastases by lymphatic permeation (Handley), the common metastases arising in the bone-marrow reach their destination through the blood-stream.Secondary cancer is a comparatively common disease, and, as in metastases in other tissues, the secondary growths resemble the parent tumour.The soft forms grow rapidly, and eat away the bone, without altering its shape or form.In slowly growing forms there may be considerable formation of imperfectly formed bone, often deficient in lime salts; this condition may be widely diffused throughout the skeleton, and, as it is associated with softening and bending of the bones, it is known as  cancerous osteomalacia .Secondary cancer of bone is attended with pain, or it suddenly attracts notice by the occurrence of pathological fracture as, for example, in the shaft of the femur or humerus.
describe: Direct Extension from Soft Parts|Cancer of Bone resulting from Direct Extension from Soft Parts.In this group there are also two clinical types.The first is met with in relation to  epithelioma of a mucous surface  for example, the palate, tongue, gums, antrum, frontal sinus, auditory meatus, or middle ear.They will be described under these special regions.The second type is met with in relation to  epithelioma occurring in a sinus , the sequel of suppurative osteomyelitis, compound fracture, or tuberculous disease.The patient has usually had a discharging sinus for a great number of years: we have known it to last as many as fifty.
describe: Cysts of Bone|"Cysts of Bone.With the exception of hydatid cysts, cysts in the interior of bone are the result of the liquefaction of solid tissue; this may be that of chondroma, myeloma, or sarcoma, but more commonly of the marrow in osteomyelitis fibrosa.CHAPTER XXI DISEASES OF JOINTS

Definition of terms Ankylosis.DISEASES: Errors of     development Bacterial diseases:  Pyogenic ;  Gonorrhœal ;      Tuberculous ;  Syphilitic ;  Acute rheumatism  Diseases     associated with certain constitutional conditions:  Gout ;  Chronic     articular rheumatism ;  Arthritis deformans ;      Hamophilia  Diseases associated with affections of the nervous     system:  Neuro-arthropathies ;  Charcot's disease  Hysterical or     mimetic affections of joints Tumours and cysts Loose bodies.Definition of Terms.The term  synovitis  is applied to any reaction which affects the synovial membrane of a joint."
describe: Tuberculous|Tuberculous Lymphangitis.Although lymph vessels play an important rôle in the spread of tuberculosis, the clinical recognition of the disease in them is exceptional.The infection spreads upwards along the superficial lymphatics, which become nodularly thickened; at one or more points, larger, peri-lymphangitic nodules may form and break down into abscesses and ulcers; the nearest group of glands become infected at an early stage.When the disease is widely distributed throughout the lymphatics of the limb, it becomes swollen and hard a condition illustrated by lupus elephantiasis.Syphilitic lymphangitis  is observed in cases of primary syphilis, in which the vessels of the dorsum of the penis can be felt as indurated cords.In addition to acting as channels for the conveyance of bacterial infection,  lymph vessels frequently convey the cells of malignant tumours , and especially cancer, from the seat of the primary disease to the nearest lymph glands, and they may themselves become the seat of cancerous growth forming nodular cords.Tuberculous Disease of Glands.This is a disease of great frequency and importance.The tubercle bacilli usually gain access to the gland through the afferent lymph vessels, which convey them from some lesion of the surface within the area drained by them.Tuberculous infection may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic septic irritation.While any of the glands in the body may be affected, the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.The appearance of the glands on section  varies with the stage of the disease.
describe: Syphilitic|Syphilitic ulcers may be met with in any part of the body, but are most frequent in the upper part of the leg (Fig.17), especially around the knee-joint in women, and over the ribs and sternum.On healing, they usually leave a depressed and adherent cicatrix.The  scorbutic ulcer  occurs in patients suffering from scurvy, and is characterised by its prominent granulations, which show a marked tendency to bleed, with the formation of clots, which dry and form a spongy crust on the surface.In  gouty  patients small ulcers which are exceedingly irritable and painful are liable to occur.Ulcers associated with Malignant Disease.Syphilitic lesions are liable to be mistaken for actinomycosis, all the more that in both diseases improvement follows the administration of iodides.When it affects the lower jaw, in its early stages, actinomycosis may closely simulate a periosteal sarcoma.The recognition of the fungus is the crucial point in diagnosis.Prognosis.Spontaneous cure rarely occurs.When the disease implicates internal organs, it is almost always fatal.
describe: Conditions of Impaired Mobility of Joints|Conditions of Impaired Mobility of Joints.There are four conditions of impaired mobility in joints: rigidity, contracture, ankylosis, and locking.Rigidity  is the fixation of a joint by involuntary contraction of muscles, and is of value as a sign of disease in deep-seated joints, such as the hip.It disappears under anasthesia.Contracture  is the term applied when the fixation is due to permanent shortening of the soft parts around a joint muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, or skin.As the structures on the flexor aspect are more liable to undergo such shortening, contracture is nearly always associated with flexion.
describe: Contracture|"DISEASES OF MUSCLE AND OF TENDONS:  Atrophy ;  ""Muscular     rheumatism""   Fibrositis ;  Contracture ;  Myositis ;      Calcification and Ossification ;  Tumours .DISEASES OF TENDON     SHEATHS:  Teno-synovitis .INJURIES  Contusion of Muscle.Contusion of muscle, which consists in bruising of its fibres and blood vessels, may be due to violence acting from without, as in a blow, a kick, or a fall; or from within, as by the displacement of bone in a fracture or dislocation.The symptoms are those common to all contusions, and the patient complains of severe pain on attempting to use the muscle, and maintains an attitude which relaxes it.If the sheath of the muscle also is torn, there is subcutaneous ecchymosis, and the accumulation of blood may result in the formation of a hamatoma.Contracture of Muscles.Permanent shortening of muscles results from the prolonged approximation of their points of attachment, or from structural changes in their substance produced by injury or by disease.It is a frequent accompaniment and sometimes a cause of deformities, in the treatment of which lengthening of the shortened muscles or their tendons may be an essential step.Myositis.Ischamic Myositis.Volkmann was the first to describe a form of myositis followed by contracture, resulting from interference with the arterial blood supply."
describe: skiagraphy|The nature and extent of ankylosis may be learned by skiagraphy; in osseous ankylosis the shadow of the two bones is a continuous one.In fibrous as contrasted with osseous ankylosis mobility may be elicited, although only to a limited extent; while in osseous ankylosis the joint is rigidly fixed, and attempts to move it are painless.The  treatment  is influenced by the nature of the original lesion, the variety of the ankylosis, and the attitude of the joint.When there is restriction of movement due to fibrous adhesions, these may be elongated or ruptured.Elongation of the adhesions may be effected by manipulations, exercises, and the use of special forms of apparatus such as the application of weights to the limb.It may be necessary to administer an anasthetic before rupturing strong fibrous adhesions, and this procedure must be carried out with caution, in view of such risks as fracture of the bone which is often rarefied or separation of an epiphysis.
describe: Arthroplasty|Arthroplasty.Murphy of Chicago devised this operation for restoring movement to an ankylosed joint.It consists in transplanting between the bones a flap of fat-bearing tissue, from which a bursal cavity lined with endothelium and containing a fluid rich in mucin is ultimately formed.Arthroplasty is most successful in ankylosis following upon injury; when the ankylosis results from some infective condition such as tuberculosis or gonorrhœa, it is liable to result in failure either because of a fresh outbreak of the infection or because the ankylosis recurs.When arthroplasty is impracticable, and a movable joint is desired for example at the elbow a considerable amount of bone, and it may be also of periosteum and capsular ligament, is resected to allow of the formation of a false joint.When bony ankylosis has occurred with the joint in an undesirable attitude for example flexion at the hip or knee it can sometimes be remedied by osteotomy or by a wedge-shaped resection of the bone, with or without such additional division of the contracted soft parts as will permit of the limb being placed in the attitude desired.Arthroplasty is most successful in ankylosis following upon injury; when the ankylosis results from some infective condition such as tuberculosis or gonorrhœa, it is liable to result in failure either because of a fresh outbreak of the infection or because the ankylosis recurs.When arthroplasty is impracticable, and a movable joint is desired for example at the elbow a considerable amount of bone, and it may be also of periosteum and capsular ligament, is resected to allow of the formation of a false joint.When bony ankylosis has occurred with the joint in an undesirable attitude for example flexion at the hip or knee it can sometimes be remedied by osteotomy or by a wedge-shaped resection of the bone, with or without such additional division of the contracted soft parts as will permit of the limb being placed in the attitude desired.Bony ankylosis of the joints of a finger, whether the result of injury or disease, is difficult to remedy by any operative procedure, for while it is possible to restore mobility, the new joint is apt to be flail-like.Locking.A joint is said to lock when its movements are abruptly arrested by the coming together of bony outgrowths around the joint.
describe: Extremities|The deformities at the knee (genu valgum, genu varum, and genu recurvatum), and at the hip (coxa vara), will be described in the volume dealing with the Extremities.The majority of cases seen in surgical practice suffer from the deformities resulting from rickets rather than from the active disease.The examination of a large series of children at different ages shows that the deformities become less and less frequent with each year.Those who recover may ultimately show no trace of rickets, and this is especially true of children who grow at the average rate; in those, however, in whom growth is retarded, especially from the fifth to the seventh year, the deformities are apt to be permanent.It may be noted that the scoliosis due to rickets has little tendency towards recovery.Treatment.The more important of these are described along with the surgery of the Extremities.DISEASES OF JOINTS  Bacterial Diseases.In most bacterial diseases the organisms are carried to the joint in the blood-stream, and they lodge either in the synovial membrane or in one of the bones, whence the disease subsequently spreads to the other structures of the joint.Organisms may also be introduced through accidental wounds.It has been shown experimentally that joints are among the most susceptible parts of the body to infection, and this would appear to be due to the viscid character of the synovial fluid, which protects organisms from bactericidal agents in the tissues and fluids.PYOGENIC DISEASES The commoner pyogenic diseases are the result of infection of one or other of the joint structures with  staphylococci  or  streptococci , which may be demonstrated in the exudate in the joint and in the substance of the synovial membrane.
describe: the pus perforates the joint capsule|If the pus perforates the joint capsule, there are signs of abscess or of diffuse suppuration in the cellular tissue.The final disorganisation of the joint is indicated by abnormal mobility and grating of the articular surfaces, or by spontaneous displacement of the bones, and this may amount to dislocation.In the acute arthritis of infants, the epiphysis concerned may be separated and displaced.When the  joint is infected through an external wound , the anatomical features are similar to those observed when the infection has reached the joint by the blood-stream, but the destructive changes tend to be more severe and are more likely to result in disorganisation.The  terminations  vary with the gravity of the infection and with the stage at which treatment is instituted.In the milder forms recovery is the rule, with more or less complete restoration of function.
describe: Pneumococcal|Pneumococcal affections of joints , the result of infection with the pneumococcus of Fraenkel, are being met with in increasing numbers.The local lesion varies from a  synovitis  with infiltration of the synovial membrane and effusion of serum or pus, to an  acute arthritis  with erosion of cartilage, caries of the articular surfaces, and disorganisation of the joint.The knee is most frequently affected, but several joints may suffer at the same time.In most cases the joint affection makes its appearance a few days after the commencement of a pneumonia, but in a number of instances, especially among children, the lung is not specially involved, and the condition is an indication of a generalised pneumococcal infection, which may manifest itself by endocarditis, empyema, meningitis, or peritonitis, and frequently has a fatal termination.The differential diagnosis from other forms of pyogenic infection is established by bacteriological examination of the fluid withdrawn from the joint.The treatment is carried out on the same lines as in other pyogenic infections, considerable reliance being placed on the use of autogenous vaccines.
describe: diplococcus|"The joint lesions which accompany  acute rheumatism  or ""rheumatic fever"" are believed to be due to a diplococcus.In the course of a general illness in which there is moderate pyrexia and profuse sweating, some of the larger joints, and not infrequently the smaller ones also, become swollen and extremely sensitive, so that the sufferer lies in bed helpless, dreading the slightest movement.From day to day fresh joints are attacked, while those first affected subside, often with great rapidity.Affections of the heart-valves and of the pericardium are commonly present.On recovery from the acute illness, it may be found that the joints have entirely recovered, but in a small proportion of cases certain of them remain stiff and pass into the crippled condition described under chronic rheumatism.There is no call for operative interference."
describe: Gonococcal Affections of Joints|Gonococcal Affections of Joints.These include all forms of joint lesion occurring in association with gonorrhœal urethritis, vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhœal ophthalmia.They may develop at any stage of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however, after the discharge has ceased.There is no connection between the severity of the gonorrhœa and the incidence of joint disease.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.
describe: gonorrhœal ophthalmia|These include all forms of joint lesion occurring in association with gonorrhœal urethritis, vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhœal ophthalmia.They may develop at any stage of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however, after the discharge has ceased.There is no connection between the severity of the gonorrhœa and the incidence of joint disease.In women, the gonorrhœal nature of the discharge must be established by bacteriological examination.As a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during the third week.The gonococcus is carried to the joint in the blood-stream and is first deposited in the synovial membrane, in the tissues of which it can usually be found; it may be impossible to find it in the exudate within the joint.
describe: Detoxicated|Detoxicated vaccines should be given from the first, and in afebrile cases the injection of a foreign protein, such as anti-typhoid vaccine, is beneficial (Harrison).Murphy has found benefit from the introduction into the joint, in the early stages, of from 5 to 15 c.c.of a 2 per cent.solution of formalin in glycerin.This may be repeated within a week, the patient being kept in bed with light weight extension.In the chronic hydrops the fluid is withdrawn, and about an ounce of a 1 per cent.
describe: The Contents of Tuberculous Joints|The Contents of Tuberculous Joints.In a large proportion of cases of synovial tuberculosis the joint is entirely filled up by the diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane.In a small number there is an abundant serous exudate, and with this there may be a considerable formation of fibrin, covering the surface of the membrane and floating in the fluid as flakes or masses; under the influence of movement it may assume the shape of melon-seed bodies.More rarely the joint contains pus, and the surface of the synovial membrane resembles the wall of a cold abscess.Ulceration and Necrosis of Cartilage.The synovial tissue covering the cartilage causes pitting and perforation of the cartilage and makes its way through it, and often spreads widely between it and the subjacent bone; the cartilage may be detached in portions of considerable size.
describe: Terminations|Terminations of Contusions.The usual termination is a complete return to the normal, some of the extravasated blood being organised, but most of it being reabsorbed.During the process characteristic alterations in the colour of the effused blood take place as a result of changes in the blood pigment.In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours the margins of the blue area become of a violet hue, and as time goes on the discoloured area increases in size, and becomes successively green, yellow, and lemon-coloured at its margins, the central part being the last to change.The rate at which this play of colours proceeds is so variable, and depends on so many circumstances, that no time-limits can be laid down.During the disintegration of the effused blood the adjacent lymph glands may become enlarged, and on dissection may be found to be pigmented.Terminations and Sequela.A natural process of cure may occur at any stage, the tuberculous tissue being replaced by scar tissue.Recovery is apt to be attended with impairment of movement due to adhesions, ankylosis, or contracture of the peri-articular structures.Caseous foci in the interior of the bones may become encapsulated, and a cure be thus effected, or they may be the cause of a relapse of the disease at a later date.Interference with growth is comparatively common, and may involve only the epiphysial junctions in the immediate vicinity of the joint affected, or those of all the bones of the limb.This is well seen in adults who have suffered from severe disease of the hip in childhood the entire limb, including the foot, being shorter and smaller than the corresponding parts of the opposite side.
describe: Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease|Clinical Variations of Tuberculous Joint Disease.The above description applies to tuberculous joint disease in general; it must be modified to include special manifestations or varieties.When the main incidence of the infection affects the synovial membrane, the clinical picture may assume the form of a  hydrops , or of an  empyema  in which the joint is filled with pus.More common than either of these is the well-known  white swelling  or  tumor albus  (Wiseman, 1676) which is the clinical manifestation of diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane along with mucoid degeneration of the peri-synovial cellular tissue.It is well seen in joints which are superficial such as the knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist.The swelling, which is the first and most prominent clinical feature, develops gradually and painlessly, obliterating the bony prominences by filling up the natural hollows.
describe: Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease|Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease on the General Health.Experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint disease are compatible with the appearance of good health.As a rule, however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers, the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be some loss of weight.Treatment.In addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis, local measures are employed.These may be described under two heads the conservative and the operative.
describe: the General Health|Influence of Tuberculous Joint Disease on the General Health.Experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint disease are compatible with the appearance of good health.As a rule, however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers, the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be some loss of weight.Treatment.In addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis, local measures are employed.These may be described under two heads the conservative and the operative.
describe: Immobilisation|Immobilisation may be secured by bandages, splints, extension, or other apparatus.Extension  with weight and pulley is of value in securing rest, especially in disease of the hip or knee; it eliminates muscular spasm, relieves pain and startings at night, and prevents abnormal attitudes of the limb.If, when the patient first comes under observation, the limb is in a deformed attitude which does not readily yield to extension, the deformity should be corrected under an anasthetic.The induction of hyperamia  is often helpful, the rubber bandage or the hot-air chamber being employed for an hour or so morning and evening.Injection of Iodoform.This is carried out on the same lines as have been described for tuberculous abscess.
describe: Operative Treatment|Operative Treatment.In aggravated cases, when the patient is suffering pain, when his occupation is interfered with by repeated attacks of phlebitis, or when there are large pouches on the veins, operative treatment is called for.The younger the patient the clearer is the indication to operate.It may be necessary to operate to enable a patient to enter one of the public services, even although no symptoms are present.The presence of an ulcer does not contra-indicate operation; the ulcer should be excised, and the raw surface covered with skin grafts, before dealing with the veins.The  operation of Trendelenburg  is especially appropriate to cases in which the trunk of the great saphena vein in the thigh is alone involved.Operative Treatment.This consists in the removal of the affected nerve or nerves, either by resection  neurectomy ; or by a combination of resection with twisting or tearing of the nerve from its central connections  avulsion .To prevent the regeneration of the nerve after these operations, the canal of exit through the bone should be obliterated; this is best accomplished by a silver screw-nail driven home by an ordinary screw-driver (Charles H. Mayo).When the neuralgia involves branches of two or of all three trunks, or when it has recurred after temporary relief following resection of individual branches, the  removal of the semilunar ganglion , along with the main trunks of the maxillary and mandibular divisions, should be considered.The operation is a difficult and serious one, but the results are satisfactory so far as the cure of the neuralgia is concerned.There is little or no disability from the unilateral paralysis of the muscles of mastication; but on account of the insensitiveness of the cornea, the eye must be protected from irritation, especially during the first month or two after the operation; this may be done by fixing a large watch-glass around the edge of the orbit with adhesive plaster.
describe: the formation of gummata|In the  tertiary stage  the joint lesions are persistent and destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or periosteum.Peri-synovial  and  peri-bursal gummata  are met with in relation to the knee-joint of middle-aged adults, especially women.They are usually multiple, develop slowly, and are rarely sensitive or painful.One or more of the gummata may break down and give rise to tertiary ulcers.The co-existence of indolent swellings, ulcers, and depressed scars in the vicinity of the knee is characteristic of tertiary syphilis.The disease spreads throughout the capsule and synovial membrane, which becomes diffusely thickened and infiltrated with granulation tissue which eats into and replaces the articular cartilage.
describe: gummata  are|Peri-synovial  and  peri-bursal gummata  are met with in relation to the knee-joint of middle-aged adults, especially women.They are usually multiple, develop slowly, and are rarely sensitive or painful.One or more of the gummata may break down and give rise to tertiary ulcers.The co-existence of indolent swellings, ulcers, and depressed scars in the vicinity of the knee is characteristic of tertiary syphilis.The disease spreads throughout the capsule and synovial membrane, which becomes diffusely thickened and infiltrated with granulation tissue which eats into and replaces the articular cartilage.Clinically, the condition resembles tuberculous disease of the synovial membrane, for which it is probably frequently mistaken, but in the syphilitic affection the swelling is nodular and uneven, and the subjective symptoms are slight, mobility is little impaired, and yet the deformity is considerable.
describe: Rheumatoid Arthritis|"Arthritis Deformans  ( Osteo-arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Rheumatic Gout, Malum Senile, Traumatic or Mechanical Arthritis ).Under the term arthritis deformans, which was first employed by Virchow, it is convenient to include a number of joint affections which have many anatomical and clinical features in common.The disease is widely distributed in the animal kingdom, both in domestic species and in wild animals in the natural state such as the larger carnivora and the gorilla; evidence of it has also been found in the bones of animals buried with prehistoric man.The morbid changes in the joints present a remarkable combination of atrophy and degeneration on the one hand and overgrowth on the other, indicating a profound disturbance of nutrition in the joint structures.The nature of this disturbance and its etiology are imperfectly known.By many writers it is believed to depend upon some form of auto-intoxication, the toxins being absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, and those who suffer are supposed to possess what has been called an ""arthritic diathesis."""
describe: gonorrhœal|It would appear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue, causing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small superficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhœal urethritis, the cicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the formation of stricture.When mucous glands are present in the membrane, the pus is mixed with mucus  muco-pus .DIFFUSE CELLULITIS AND DIFFUSE SUPPURATION Cellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some organism commonly the  streptococcus pyogenes  into the cellular connective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon sheaths, or other structures.Infection always takes place through a breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail, and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation becomes manifest.The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the lymphatics.The virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in which they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which they are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.A  gonorrhœal  form of myositis is sometimes met with; it is painful, but rarely goes on to suppuration.In the early secondary period of  syphilis , the muscles may be the seat of dull, aching, nocturnal pains, especially in the neck and back.Syphilitic contracture  is a condition which has been observed chiefly in the later secondary period; the biceps of the arm and the hamstrings in the thigh are the muscles more commonly affected.The striking feature is a gradually increasing difficulty of extending the limb at the elbow or knee, and progressive flexion of the joint.The affected muscle is larger and firmer than normal, and its electric excitability is diminished.In tertiary syphilis, individual muscles may become the seat of interstitial myositis or of gummata, and these affections readily yield to anti-syphilitic remedies.
describe: Hypertrophied|Hypertrophied Scars.Scars occasionally broaden out and become prominent, and on exposed parts this may prove a source of disappointment after operations such as those for goitre or tuberculous glands in the neck.There is sometimes considerable improvement from exposure to the X-rays.Keloid.This term is applied to an overgrowth of scar tissue which extends beyond the area of the original wound, and the name is derived from the fact that this extension occurs in the form of radiating processes, suggesting the claws of a crab.It is essentially a fibroma or new growth of fibrous tissue, which commences in relation to the walls of the smaller blood vessels; the bundles of fibrous tissue are for the most part parallel with the surface, and the epidermis is tightly stretched over them.Hypertrophied fringes and pedunculated or loose bodies  often co-exist with hydrops, and give rise to characteristic clinical features, particularly in the knee.The fringes, especially when they assume the type of the arborescent lipoma, project into the cavity of the joint, filling up its recesses and distending its capsule so that the joint is swollen and slightly flexed.Pain is not a prominent feature, and the patient may walk fairly well.On grasping the joint while it is being actively flexed and extended, the fringes may be felt moving under the fingers.Symptoms from impaction of a loose body are exceptional.The dry form of arthritis deformans , although specially common in the knee, is met with in other joints, either as a mon-articular or poly-articular disease; and it is also met with in the joints of the spine and of the fingers as well as in the temporo-mandibular joint.
describe: nd of tonics|Benefit is also derived from the administration of cod-liver oil, and of tonics, such as strychnin, arsenic, and iron, and in some cases of iodide of potassium.Luff recommends the administration over long periods of guaiacol carbonate, in cachets beginning with doses of 5–10 grs.and increased to 15–20 grs.thrice daily.A course of treatment at one of the reputed spas Aix, Bath, Buxton, Gastein, Harrogate, Strathpeffer, Wiesbaden, Wildbad is often beneficial.In some cases benefit has followed the prolonged internal administration of liquid paraffin.
describe: thrice daily|The skin of the affected area should be painted with iodine, and a Klapp's suction bell applied thrice daily.If pus forms, the skin is frozen with ethyl-chloride and a small incision made, after which the application of the suction bell is persevered with.The further treatment consists in the use of diluted boracic or resin ointment.In multiple boils on the trunk and limbs, lysol or boracic baths are of service; the underclothing should be frequently changed, and that which is discarded must be disinfected.In patients with recurrence of boils about the neck, re-infection frequently takes place from the scalp, to which therefore treatment should be directed.Any impaired condition of health should be corrected; when, there is sugar or albumen in the urine the conditions on which these depend must receive appropriate treatment.thrice daily.A course of treatment at one of the reputed spas Aix, Bath, Buxton, Gastein, Harrogate, Strathpeffer, Wiesbaden, Wildbad is often beneficial.In some cases benefit has followed the prolonged internal administration of liquid paraffin.On the assumption that the condition is the result of an auto-intoxication from the intestinal tract, saline purges and irrigation of the colon are indicated, and Arbuthnot Lane claims to have brought about improvement by short-circuiting or by resecting the colon.Residence in a warm and dry climate, with an open-air life, has been known to arrest the disease when other measures have failed to give relief.The application of radium and the ingestion of radio-active waters have also been recommended.
describe: anasthesia|The patient is given a general anasthetic, or regional anasthesia is obtained by injections of a solution of one per cent.novocain into the line of the lateral and middle cutaneous nerves; the disinfection of the skin is carried out on the usual lines, any chemical agent being finally got rid of, however, by means of alcohol followed by saline solution.The strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly transferred to the surface, for which they should be made to form a complete carpet, slightly overlapping the edges of the area and of one another; some blunt instrument is used to straighten out the strips, which are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express blood and air-bells and to ensure accurate contact, for this must be as close as that between a postage stamp and the paper to which it is affixed.As a dressing for the grafted area and of that also from which the grafts have been taken, gauze soaked in  liquid paraffin  the patent variety known as  ambrine  is excellent appears to be the best; the gauze should be moistened every other day or so with fresh paraffin, so that, at the end of a week, when the grafts should have united, the gauze can be removed without risk of detaching them.Dental wax  is another useful type of dressing; as is also  picric acid  solution.Over the gauze, there is applied a thick layer of cotton wool, and the whole dressing is kept in place by a firmly applied bandage, and in the case of the limbs some form of splint should be added to prevent movement.To allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anasthesia, to cut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the infected area, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely.If only a small opening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations.Subcutaneous Whitlow.In this variety the infection manifests itself as a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (Fig.9, c), which sometimes spreads towards the palm of the hand.The finger becomes red, swollen, and tense; there is severe throbbing pain, which is usually worst at night and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure.
describe: The Weir-Mitchell|The Weir-Mitchell treatment may have to be employed in obstinate cases, the patient being secluded from her friends and placed in charge of a nurse.Complete recovery is the rule, but when the muscles are weak and wasted from prolonged disuse, a considerable time may elapse before the limb returns to normal.TUMOURS AND CYSTS New growths taking origin in the synovial membrane are rare, and are not usually diagnosed before operation.They are attended with exudation into the joint, and in the case of  sarcoma  the fluid is usually blood-stained.If the tumour projects in a polypoidal manner into the joint, it may cause symptoms of loose body.One or two cases have been recorded in which a  cartilaginous tumour  growing from the synovial membrane has erupted through the joint capsule and infiltrated the adjoining muscles.
describe: Organised Connective Tissue|Bodies composed of Organised Connective Tissue.These are comparatively common in joints that are already the seat of some chronic disease, such as arthritis deformans, Charcot's arthropathy, or synovial tuberculosis.They take origin almost exclusively from an erratic overgrowth of the fringes of the synovial membrane, and may consist entirely of fat, the arborescent lipoma (Fig.159) being the most pronounced example of this variety.Fibrous tissue or cartilage may form in one or more of the fatty fringes and give rise to hard nodular masses, which may attain a considerable size, and in course of time may undergo ossification.Like other hypertrophies on a free surface, they tend to become pedunculated, and so acquire a limited range of movement.
describe: Loose Bodies in Joints|Loose Bodies in Joints which are otherwise healthy.It is in joints otherwise healthy that loose bodies causing the classical symptoms and calling for operative treatment are most frequently met with.They occur chiefly in the knee and elbow of healthy males under the age of thirty.The complaint may be of vague pains, of occasional cracking on moving the joint, or of impairment of function usually an inability to extend or flex the joint completely.In many cases a clear account is given of the symptoms which arise when the body is impacted between the articular surfaces, namely, sudden onset of intense sickening pain, loss of power in the limb and locking of the joint, followed by effusion and other accompaniments of a severe sprain.On some particular movement, the body is disengaged, the locking disappears, and recovery takes place.
