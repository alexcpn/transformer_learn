Wages are rising, the yen is weak, and the gap with other central banks is ever wider\tWHY NOT? Inflation is falling\tUS stocks really are concentrated, but that’s because Big Tech makes all the profits.\tRIP Karl Wallinger; he was the one\n      Godot Arrives in Japan???\nCherry blossom season is starting in Japan, but the hopes of international investors are turned toward what they hope will be a much rarer event. Next week, if the speculation is to be believed, there’s a real chance that the Bank of Japan will announce its exit from a policy of negative interest rates and declare an end to the country’s deflationary era. We’ve been here before, and previous recoveries have ended in disappointment. (For a look at the Japan narrative,   read Bloomberg Opinion’s Daniel Moss.) But this time,  Godot might arrive, and Charlie Brown might kick the football, because exiting the  unconventional monetary policy known as Yield Curve Control (YCC) has been made feasible by rising inflation. The announcement could — some truly believe — come as soon as next week’s meeting, although April seems a safer bet. This year’s wage negotiations, known as shunto (or “spring fight” — the process always ends in cherry blossom time), was arguably the last variable with the potential of scuppering the central bank’s plans. Recent reports suggest that workers are in line to walk away with about 3.5% more in base pay, which should drive an improvement in household real incomes, shoring up domestic consumption and leading to inflation peaking around the BOJ’s target.The main argument against comes from the latest inflation numbers, which show a swift deceleration after the headline peaked at 4%. This might thwart the BOJ next week. \nA potential hike sharply contrasts expectations for easing in the US and the eurozone. There is little debate about the unconventionality of Japan’s monetary policy. Having maintained this stance even through the uncertainty of the pandemic, questions on where a hike leaves the economy are legitimate. Japanese equities markets have been on a roll, with the Nikkei 225 and Topix enjoying record runs. The Nikkei at last broke a record high that had stood since the last day of 1989. The central bank’s policy split from the rest of the world began to form after the Japanese equity bubble burst in early 1990. Since then, as the economy lapsed into deflation, the BOJ either cautiously followed the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle (2000 and 2006), or stayed put. Its rates have been persistently low. That divergence has more recently been at an extreme. The BOJ adopted YCC and negative rates in 2016, in the wake of China’s devaluation. At that time, the eurozone’s rates were also pegged to zero. But in the last two years, Japan has remained below zero while others have returned to something like normal: \nCiti Research’s Dirk Willer and his team note that in the two cases the BOJ followed the Fed’s cue, it only hiked when the Fed was on hold — and as a result, those cycles were short-lived. Then, as now, it needs to monitor what other central banks do:History would therefore suggest that, once more, the BOJ will not get all that far in its cycle, even though it will be clearly easier to hike during preemptive Fed cuts, as opposed to Fed cuts driven by recession fears. But even preemptive Fed cuts will matter for the BOJ, partly by removing the upward pressure on USDJPY, which in turn will lower inflation pressures in Japan, which in turn will feed through to wages.Getting ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle will likely relax pressure on the yen, which is currently trading at record lows — it’s at the weakest for the effective exchange rate in 33 years, and for the real effective rate since 1970.\nWhile this might not be good news for exporters, Gavekal’s Tom Holland argues this concern could be exaggerated. He believes that if the yen strengthens from current levels, there will be a direct translation effect on the yen value of Japan Inc.’s overseas earnings. Then there’s the impact on Japanese stocks. Generally, traders are used to assuming that a weak yen will mean stronger stocks and vice versa. It also prompts Japanese equity investors to park money outside the country. Could a stronger yen reverse this? Holland argues that the “reasonably close correlation between the Topix and the yen” over the last 20 years might not necessarily be a guide:Notably, when the yen strengthened by 35% between late 1998 and the end of 1999, the Topix climbed 36% in yen terms, for a US dollar gain of 49%. Similarly, the yen and the Topix also gained in tandem in the early 2000s on hopes that financial sector reform would boost growth. Much the same could happen again, especially if yen appreciation triggers large-scale repatriation of foreign assets by Japanese institutions.The impending hike isn’t expected to have much effect on cash rates. The 10-year JGB has already priced in the initial hike that lifts rate above zero. Still, the BOJ has plenty to do to keep rates in check going forward. Bank of America’s Izumi Devalier and her team note that the central bank signaling that the pace of its JGB purchases will remain largely unchanged — per the bank’s base case forecast — would do a lot to calm the markets and price out the risk of quantitative tightening in the near term.\nJapanese equities have a lot going well for them, and if tighter money prompts repatriation, they could continue that run. The questions is how much strength the yen regains on this tightening, when other central banks are on the verge of cutting. Whoever takes the baton, whether the Fed or the European Central Bank, the BOJ Japan will very much be on guard to see how rate cuts elsewhere trickle down to its prices. —Richard Abbey\n      Anatomy of Magnificence\nYou might have read a little in this newsletter about the current incredible dominance of a few giant US tech companies, and whether their rise is sustainable. Now, very handily, comes a great drill-down by Barclays Plc’s equity strategist Venu Krishna. Here are some highlights of what proves to be truly exceptional, and what is less so.First off, we find that using the  Herfindahl index, a standard statistical measure of economic inequality, shows great concentration at the top of the market — very much more so than even the last equity bubble of 2000:\nWhy is this happening? In large part because Big Tech (defined as Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.) is fantastically profitable. Its profit margin of 23.4% is more than double that of the rest of the S&P 500. Well-publicized layoffs have only improved profitability:\nSo these companies are in a genuinely strong competitive position, and using it to make big profits. If we define margins via earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, then we find the tech sector’s margins almost doubled over the last 25 years, and remained flat for everyone else. The world uses computers these days, bought at prices that help tech companies’ earnings more than their customers’:\nWhen it comes to what Krishna calls the Big Six (Barclays excluded Tesla Inc. from the Magnificent Seven on the basis that it’s better regarded as an industrial concern), then the group turns out to be more diverse than many appreciate. Mapping projected sales and earnings growth for the next two years reveals that Nvidia is almost off the charts, literally, while Apple isn’t expected to fare significantly better than the 494 stocks in the rest of the S&P 500. This creates opportunities for fund managers to show their worth by picking the right Big Six companies. And it’s evident that expectations on the firms are very high:\nAs for valuation, Krishna’s analysis confirms that the Big Six don’t look overvalued by conventional metrics. The issue instead is whether they can maintain growth on their current trajectory. Using the PEG ratio (the price/earnings to growth ratio, which compares the current valuation multiples to growth in earnings over previous years), we find that Big Tech is actually cheaper than the S&P 500. It’s also very much cheaper than European and other non-US stocks, thanks to their far inferior growth rate. Again, the key question: Can the Big Six keep doing this?\nKrishna also has an answer for the fear that the Big Tech groups cannot keep increasing sales at the rate that the market currently expects. Revenue forecasts are indeed higher than for the rest of the market — but as the chart shows, they’re comfortably lower than pre-pandemic levels. Some of these companies are still quite young and not far removed from their period of explosive growth, so it’s important not to put too much weight on this. But the point, that at the least the current forecasts don’t rely on sales to keep growing ever faster into the middle distance, is well taken:\nIn previous eras of over-concentration, the companies that broke away from the pack also led the way down. The Nifty 50 stocks of the 1960s, or the dot-com darlings of the late 1990s, were really bad places to be once the market turned. And indeed, Big Tech led the fall as interest rates rose in 2022. However, Krishna points out that they’re not usually that strongly aligned with the rest of the S&P, and that correlations rise when the overall market sells off. That implies there’s no protection to be gained from these companies in the event of a major plunge. It also suggests that the risks of holding them aren’t as serious as they might appear. \nIt will still be very difficult for them to maintain their lead. Over the years, investing in the biggest companies at any one time has tended not to work. All the good news is in their price already. As they’ve had great news recently, that price is arguably reasonable — and Krishna points out that they offer quality, growth and momentum, all the factors that are driving the broader market. Rather than watch the price action, it probably remains most important to track exactly how well these companies do at growing revenues and profits. They’ve set quite a pace for themselves. Slowing would harm their share prices. \n      "

        "content": "        Hopes for fed funds cuts this year look potentially overdone; Next week’s new dot plot from the FOMC could set the cat among the pigeons; St\n      Today’s Points\n\tHopes for fed funds cuts this year look  potentially overdone;\tNext week’s new  dot plot from the FOMC could set the cat among the pigeons;\tStock markets have decided they don’t need more rate cuts anyway;\tThat’s because of a startling inflection in US profits, and amazing market  momentum\tAND even more  guitar solos (including a couple performed with  Miles Davis)\n      So Near and Yet So Far\nTuesday’s core CPI print for February came in hotter than expected, yet the stock market wasn’t bothered. For much of 2023, the S&P 500 moved inversely to expected fed funds rates, with the index selling off while the Federal Reserve was expected to keep rates “higher for longer” early last fall, and then surging as the central bank pivoted toward cuts. But so far this year, the number of cuts has been cut back aggressively, and the stock market doesn’t mind. This terminal chart, comparing the S&P 500 to the implicit fed funds rate for next January (on an inverted scale), shows a clear inverted correlation last year that has now disappeared:\nAbout a week ago, Jay Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed is inching closer to the confidence needed to cut rates. In other words, his message was that the Fed wanted to cut, but didn’t think the data would yet allow it. If we’re to go by the muted reaction, markets are erring on Powell’s side. Even more so, the Fed’s preferred price gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is somewhat retreating toward the Fed’s 2% target, though not at the pace that inspires a lot of confidence for easing policy.Do We Have Any Cuts to Look Forward to?Powell’s suggestion of an imminent cut is instructive, but pouring cold water on the core CPI, which topped analysts’ estimates for a consecutive month, might be a tad imprudent. If there’s one thing clear about the Fed’s posturing, it’s that they’re in no rush to cut, even if they’d like to. The CPI continued a run of data suggesting the cautious stance was sensible. Wall Street luminaries including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and Citadel Group’s Ken Griffin made clear in well-publicized speeches that they agree.The Bureau of Labor Statistics measure of the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.4% in February, bringing the year-on-year change to 3.8% (versus 3.9% prior). Beneath the core figure, the pace of shelter inflation offers some respite, although core goods disinflation appears to have stalled, says Bloomberg Economics’ Anna Wong:\nThe heat from inflation hasn’t dampened the stock market, with the S&P hitting yet another new high Tuesday. It’s not that the market is undisturbed; if anything the reaction speaks to the overall trend in the  disinflationary process. But there are also worrying signs that inflation is not decelerating as fast as it should, says FS Investments’ Lara Rhame, who describes the low-inflation pre-Covid economy as a place where:Markets and forecasters became somewhat complacent around what they considered a natural resting place of inflation. Today, the whole picture surrounding inflation including wages and services prices are too high, and are inconsistent with a fast track back to 2%. Since January, investors have been dialing back the number of rate cuts expected for the year. Bloomberg’s World Interest Rate Probabilities now indicate up to at least three cuts by year-end, with the first not happening until the second half. In this, they’re in almost exact agreement with the Fed, whose  dot plot — in which each member of the Federal Open Market Committee shows where they expect rates to be with a dot on a chart — also points to total cuts of 75 basis points (three cuts) by then. If there is a risk surrounding next week’s meeting, where the fed funds rate will almost certainly remain unchanged, it concerns the dots, which will be updated for the first time since December. Markets tend to look for the median prediction, but as SMBC Nikko’s Joe Lavorgna shows in this annotated version of the latest dots, it would take only two voters to shift to move the median for the end of 2024 to either two or four cuts. It only needs one to shift the median for the end of 2025 in either direction:\nThere are arguments that the data could prompt the necessary members to shift toward one fewer cut this year. Earl Davis of BMO Asset Management says that the Fed is unlikely to cut until at least the third quarter should inflation data follow the path of the last two months:Base effects will only lead to higher inflation over the next three months, all else equal. If CPI year on year could not tick down more from a higher inflation print in February 2023, then it points to higher inflation ahead, given the lower monthly prints for March (+0.1%), April (+0.4), and May (+0.4). This mechanically results in higher inflation prints ahead (all else equal).More painfully slow progress in disinflation will increase the risk that the Fed is stuck on hold. However, others say that the first cut should come in the summer, providing wages and consumer spending have shown signs of a sustainable moderation. Nicholas Elfner of Breckinridge Capital argues: “What’s going on is indicative of the economy and market participants are grappling with where the Fed is going. But the Fed’s been pretty clear with its messaging, its median dot plot, and where it expects inflation to be going over time.” What Elfner describes as “noise in the inflation data from time to time” could easily turn deafening if it persists beyond what we’ve seen in the first two months. That may sound too hypothetical, but it’s not far from the reality preventing the Fed from making a rash decision. Guy Berger of The Burning Glass Institute makes the point that the Fed could be staring down the barrel of no cuts – barring a very sharp deterioration in the economy if key inflation measures seen so far do not improve:It is not hard for me to imagine that we’re standing here heading into the June meeting, we are starting to get data that looks good again. There’s a huge range of possible outcomes.It’s reassuring that the Fed estimates they’re not too far from the necessary confidence to cut rates; less comforting that the market seems so certain that the data will bring that confidence. A potential easing remains so close and yet so far. — Richard AbbeyWhy Doesn’t It Matter?Part of the confident stock market performance is down to traders’ comfort that they understand the Fed’s reaction function, and that rate cuts are on the way — even if, as with disinflation, the process is infuriatingly slow.But by far the biggest reason is that corporate earnings have turned up very significantly. This is most dramatically the case for the Nasdaq-100, where all the tech titans abide. Projected profits have also taken a historic leap:\nNote that the picture for the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) index of developed markets outside the US is radically different. Profits have still failed to top their level from 2007, before the Global Financial Crisis. Growth is unexceptional:\nProviding the profits of the big US companies prove to be sustainable, and the predictions for the future are broadly accurate, then the market is comfortable that the rally can carry on a while longer. Stronger profitability would tend to imply a better economy and less need for rate cuts, but the calculation is that a higher rate isn’t a problem if it’s discounting substantially higher profits. Another factor, following Isaac Newton, is sheer momentum. The US stock market has quite a head of steam, and once it has momentum is hard to stop. Since the last big selloff in October, the S&P 500 hasn’t suffered a peak-to-trough fall of even as much as 2% once, its longest such streak in six years. It’s also led, to an extent not seen seen since just before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, by the stocks that have momentum. Strategies that involve betting on winners (at the moment, mostly those companies connected to artificial intelligence) to keep winning and laggards to keep lagging are doing remarkably well. When the herd is running like this, nobody wants to get in the way:\nBulls also argue that the market is growing broader, and less alarmingly concentrated, even if it’s still obviously led by the big tech groups. It’s possible to overstate this. If we compare the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 (in which every company has a 0.2% weighting regardless of size, making it in effect a measure of the “average stock”) to the cap-weighted version, then it is indeed true that the average stock is beginning to outperform. But not by much, and certainly not by enough to cancel a protracted period of domination by the largest stocks:\nPut reasonable optimism about profits together with the kind of forward motion that nobody wants to stand against, and it’s not surprising that the stock market can deal with some disappointing shifts in the interest rate landscape. It’s critical now to make sure that profits are really growing on a sustainable trajectory, and remember that when momentum finally reverses, it does so in a big way. \n      "

        "content": "        Tech share prices may not be in a bubble — but their earnings might well be Bubbles can form in fundamentals; just look at banks before the \n      Today’s Points\n\tTech share prices may not be in a bubble — but their earnings might well be\tBubbles can form in fundamentals; just look at banks before the GFC\tNvidia’s sales and profit margins are totally breathtaking\tMeta’s share price shows a   Donald Trump rant can still move markets AND\tMore great guitar solos (but Comfortably Numb is still out ahead)  \n      AI Think This Might Be a Bubble…\nThe subject won’t go away. Indeed, the interest in it continues to inflate. So it’s necessary to dive yet again into the question of whether what we’re seeing at present is a stock market bubble, a focused bubble in artificial intelligence beneficiaries (led by Nvidia Corp.), or a still-healthy bull market. The argument that it isn’t a bubble rests on valuation; for example, Mislav Matejka of JPMorgan argues that the valuations of the “Magnificent Seven” big tech groups are currently lower relative to the rest of the S&P 500 than the average of the past five years.It makes sense to take this approach. Investment bubbles are generally about crowd behavior and over-enthusiasm, so you can trace  them in valuations and price action; but it’s important to understand that some bubbles can be driven by the fundamentals of the companies themselves. The bubble of over-enthusiasm comes from people buying their products and the prices they’ll pay, rather than from overheated behavior in the market, but the results can be similar. Exhibit A is the great burst bubble in financial stocks that helped precipitate the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The KBW banks index, covering only the biggest US banks (no regionals, specialist mortgage lenders or investment banks here), burst in epic fashion:\nThe ramp-up in share prices before the burst wasn’t that extreme. And indeed, if you checked valuation (shown on the left in the following graphic by price to book value, the most popular metric for bank stocks), nothing untoward was going on. Valuations were even trending down a little during the middle of that decade. If you look at the revenues they were making (shown as revenues per basic share on the right), however, it should have been glaringly obvious that something wasn’t right. These were established businesses, and yet their revenues doubled in about three years:\nThey were able to do this because of a massive credit bubble, which they had themselves largely instigated. These revenues were arguably always illusory, and certainly never sustainable, and they collapsed, bringing down share prices as they went. Valuations hadn’t looked overdone in advance of the crash, but that was beside the point. Something similar can be said about the the tech sector as a whole, which in 1999 was very profitable, more so than the S&P 500. Note that this chart, from ProShares’ Simeon Hyman, covers return on common equity, based on the return companies made in terms of their profits rather than their share price. They were much more profitable than that last year. \nAs Hyman points out, the 2000 bubble “turned out to be not just a stock price bubble, but also a bubble in fundamental performance.” Could that happen again? The argument that this time is different from the dot-com bubble is that many companies were accorded huge valuations before they’d made any profits, or sometimes even revenues, while now the focus is on companies providing “picks and shovels,” or infrastructure that makes AI possible, led of course by Nvidia. Thankfully, there is a clear comparison from 2000. Cisco Systems Inc. built routers, the picks and shovels of the internet, and in early 2000 it briefly became the world’s largest company on the back of enthusiasm for it. Comparing the valuation back then to Nvidia’s over the last few years, both peaked at a trailing p/e of more than 200 (not sensible). Nvidia’s multiple peaked last summer in much the same way that Cisco’s did just as the dot-com bubble  burst. What’s strange is that Nvidia’s p/c has since come down in almost identical fashion to the collapse of Cisco’s valuation 24 years ago. Using valuation as a yardstick, there was indeed a Cisco-style melt-up in Nvidia, but it’s over:\nIs p/e the right metric? If we compare the two picks-and-shovels manufacturers on the basis of their multiple to sales, we get a different picture:\nThe preceding 12 months to the bubble peaks look close to identical, but Nvidia was enjoying much loftier sales multiples for a while before the bubble inflated in earnest. The big difference is that Nvidia’s price/sales multiple hit a ledge and is rising again, while Cisco’s at this point had returned almost to normal. That higher sales multiple was achieved on the back of a massive increase in sales. The following chart indexes Cisco’s revenues in the three years leading to its peak, compared to Nvidia’s since 2020. What’s just happened to Nvidia’s sales is extraordinary, and yet shares are being priced on the assumption that they’re sustainable. In the decade after 2000, as the internet took over all our lives,  revenue growth for Cisco was unspectacular:\nThe reason that the market will accord such a multiple to sales is that Nvidia has achieved the remarkable feat of selling much more stuff, and making a much bigger profit on everything sold. This chart compares Nvidia’s profit margins from 2014 to Cisco’s starting in 1990. What’s just happened to Nvidia is jaw-dropping:\nTo be clear, Nvidia is doing something special, and selling real products to people who want to buy them. This isn’t the pre-GFC banking boom. But it’s hard to see how growth like this can be sustained. The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked intense excitement and prompted many businesses to buy a lot of stuff from Nvidia to help build their own AI businesses. That, we may discover, is a bubble. Even if it isn’t, it’s impossible to see growth like this being sustained, and difficult to envisage sales even continuing at their current level.\n    The price/sales multiples couldn’t be sustained. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nChatGPT evidently changed things. Jeremy Grantham, the founder of GMO, who warned of a bubble in the aftermath of the “ridiculous speculation” inspired by the pandemic, concedes in a new letter that even after that bubble “burst conventionally enough” in 2022 (the S&P’s performance in the first half of the year was the worst since 1939), that one new app made a difference:This historically familiar pattern was rudely interrupted in December 2022 by the launch of ChatGPT and consequent public awareness of a new transformative technology — AI, which seems likely to be every bit as powerful and world-changing as the internet, and quite possibly much more so.However, it’s possible to accept that AI will be transformative and still hold that this is a bubble, as Grantham does:Even though, I admit, there is no clear historical analogy to this strange new beast, the best guess is still that this second investment bubble — in AI — will at least temporarily deflate and probably facilitate a more normal ending to the original bubble, which we paused in December 2022 to admire the AI stocks. If we dig further, there’s evidence for the notion that earnings themselves are in the unsustainable bubble. Technology takes roughly the same share of global and US market cap as in 2000, and hasn’t exceeded it. With tech businesses much more mature now, that is defensible. But if we look at tech’s share of earnings, it’s far higher than 24 years ago: \nAs Ian Harnett of London’s Absolute Strategy Research, which produced the chart, puts it: The risk is that the market is engaging in its own Generative-AI ‘hallucination’ about how long these AI-related supra-normal sales and earnings can persist. US Tech earnings already account for 23% of US earnings. In the past 50 years, only Energy (1980), Healthcare (1992) and Consumer Discretionary stocks (1978 & 2017) briefly managed to sustain 20%+ shares of total US earnings. Once a sector reaches this scale, the issue is ‘where/how can you generate incremental EPS growth?’Even if AI continues to grow as excitingly as the internet did in the first decade of this century, that’s still a question that has to be asked, and the answer is not at all clear. JPMorgan’s Matejka says that the sector isn’t “immune” to profit disappointments, but should have greater earnings resilience than more conventional cyclical companies. And that is the crucial question we should be asking: Can earnings that have grown so fast possibly be sustained?  —Assistance by Richard Abbey\n      Donald Still Trumps the Markets\nOn a quiet day in markets ahead of inflation results, Meta Platforms Inc. had too much excitement, enduring by far its worst day relative to the market since the current rally began at the end of 2022. And it was Donald Trump who did it.Speaking to CNBC in the morning, Trump explained that he was reversing his support for a ban on the social media app TikTok, or a move to force a change in ownership, because “without TikTok, you’re going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people.” Much of his interview was rambling, and he appeared to agree that TikTok, which is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government, was a national security risk — but said the same problem applied to any company that did business with China. If the front-runner to take over as president of the US calls you an enemy of the people, your share price will fall. And so it did:\nFor the full unappetizing story of how Trump appears to have made this 180-degree turn, read this  superb post by former Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Smith. Without getting into the weeds of the  security issues posed by TikTok, let it suffice for now to say that a change in ownership needn’t change Facebook’s competitive position one jot, and that if the competitive position of Facebook’s parent Meta is too strong for the nation’s good (and yes, there’s a fair argument that it is), then the obvious remedy would be to break it up on antitrust grounds. It happened to Standard Oil and AT&T, after all, and Republicans were in the White House both times. For now, brace for more of this. There are still almost eight months until the election.\n      "

If you wanted evidence that the labor market was at last calming down in a way that would eventually allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates, it was there in the US unemployment data Friday. Most importantly, given the weight put by the central bank on the risk of overheating wage inflation, average hourly earnings saw their lowest month-on-month rise in two years. That tended to support the notion that January’s reading, much higher than expected, had been a fluke:\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked up. This matters, as a rising unemployment rate is the basis for the so-called Sahm Rule (named for Bloomberg Opinion colleague Claudia Sahm) for gauging the risk of a recession. Based on the historical experience that when unemployment rises a certain amount it will tend to tip much higher, the rule holds that when the three-month rolling average unemployment rate is more than 50 basis points above the lowest point of the preceding 12 months, a recession is starting. After falling for three months, this number rose back to 27 basis points, a level that still implies that  a recession is far from inevitable, but does tend to reintroduce the possibility once more:\nIf you were actually  waiting for a sign that the Fed can start cutting rates after all, this was more or less exactly what you should have wanted — an excuse for a “bad news is good news” rally, in which the prospect of lower rates drowned out the negative implications for the economy. It didn’t happen that way, with the stock market slipping — although after its recent surge, there’s nothing too worrying about that. Nvidia Corp.’s market cap dropped almost $120 billion on Friday, but that still left it up $210 billion for the month.To some extent, this was because the news might have been “bad” (except for central bankers), but it wasn’t terrible. The data show an economy gently trending in the right direction, but it will need to do so more quickly to force the Fed to act. As Steven Blitz of GlobalData TS Lombard puts it, growth will continue because “while the job market is softer, it is not soft, and this stalls disinflation.” Another reason the numbers didn’t have more impact is that they will be followed Tuesday morning by consumer price inflation data, which is more important. The expectation is almost universal that disinflation will continue, but at a snail’s pace. Any whispered-about strength would cause a scare. That probably explains why the bond market didn’t react to the possibly good news on rates, while stocks didn’t like the idea that maybe the economy was going to land after all: \nMeanwhile, the currency markets — in which the dollar would benefit from fed funds hikes and higher inflation — sound a warning. The two variables to watch are the gold price and the Japanese yen. The dollar is falling against its main trading partners, in what may reflect anxiety, but it’s just had a startling drop against gold, which has broken out to set new records:\nGenerally, gold fares well on rate cuts, while the dollar is weakened. But the probability of rate cuts has barely budged in bond markets and futures, while currencies have moved sharply. That implies that the gold market is picking up something it doesn’t like. As Eric Robertsen of Standard Chartered Plc puts it, gold is “perhaps validating the view that markets are oscillating between two scenarios — rate cuts now or rate cuts later.” Gold is the traditional hedge against feckless monetary and fiscal policy, after all. Another signal that something doesn’t fit comes from the yen. It continues to be exceptionally weak. This is so despite resumed speculation that the Bank of Japan might actually raise its policy overnight rate from the -0.1% at which it has been anchored since 2016, and do so as early as its meeting next week, just before we hear from the Federal Open Market Committee.  This would be a big deal. Bloomberg analysis of the overnight index swap market suggests that the odds of a hike rose sharply last week.  \nJapanese inflation is picking up from low levels. It looks as though the official recession at the end of last year will be revised away once all the data are checked. It also seems as though the shunto — the big spring wage negotiations — will deliver enough of an increase in real wages to convince the BOJ that it’s safe to hike. It still looks a little stretched to expect them to have the confidence to hike in March. But as the speculation is real, you’d expect an impact that strengthens the yen. Yet it’s as weak as ever, and the “carry trade” of borrowing in yen and parking in higher-yielding currencies like the Mexican peso continues to go gangbusters:\nIt really looks like time to pull some of that risk off the table and take profits, but carry traders aren’t doing it. That implies a very real chance of a vintage mess when markets finally adjust to the yen’s new reality. That’s the kind of situation where gold thrives — so the nerves are there even as the appetite for risk-taking appears undimmed. \n      De-risking China\nThe pace of deglobalization is picking up and becoming hard to ignore. Whether steeped in political rhetoric or not, the popularity of protectionist policies for economic reasons is coinciding with a global de-risking from China, chiefly on national security concerns. US sanctions on Chinese imports under Donald Trump were an important development in the drama that’s currently playing out. Under President Joe Biden, Beijing has come under even tighter security measures, with a potential Trump re-election only worsening matters.China’s recovery efforts from the pandemic have been slow. Beijing is targeting a growth rate of around 5%, primarily driven by renewed spending on infrastructure. It’s a far cry from Xi Jinping’s “Common Prosperity” agenda, which was intended to shift growth drivers from manufacturing and exports to consumption. Other countries are ready to fill the void, and the shift in US imports away from Beijing is conspicuous. As shown in the Societe Generale chart below, for the first time since China overtook Canada as the chief source of US imports in 2008, it is no longer America’s biggest trade partner, a title that once more belongs to Mexico. \nIt’s hard to see a return to the status quo. Rather, Beijing is already exploring new markets to replace lost US business, notes SocGen’s Manish Kabra: On top of this, the need for import substitution and incentives like the production-linked incentive scheme in India to develop a manufacturing ecosystem have led to increased foreign investment in manufacturing in some of these countries.Regulatory incentives such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, Chips Act, and the European Union’s European Chips Act have accelerated big industrial policies with remarkable successes so far. But would a new administration in the US create headwinds to these incentives? UBS’s Michelle Laliberte argues that critical infrastructure and semiconductors are both tied to national security, which should reduce the risk of significant budget cuts under a change in administrations:Despite the challenges and uncertainty that lie ahead, the efforts being made to upgrade US infrastructure and build out domestic manufacturing capabilities should drive further growth opportunities for the companies positively exposed.China’s pain cuts through its stock market as well. After the slump of 2023, hopes of a rally engineered by stimulus announcements at the  ongoing National People's Congress — a forum the leadership traditionally uses to announce new policies — fizzled out. The raft of measures did little to address the structural issues in the  property and banking sectors, leaving investors with little hope of a turnaround. Unsurprisingly, the S&P China ADR Index of American-listed Chinese companies’ performance has been muted. Investors are looking away. The resurgence of enthusiasm for Japan adds to China’s difficulties. The implicit assumption from market movements is that China will be hurt by the west’s de-risking while everyone else benefits:\nZeroing in on the sectors of China’s economy that are most dependent on exports (and in which their developed-world competitors should logically be best placed to benefit from re-reshoring), there are signs that international capital is already moving. Since inception at the start of last year, the MSCI World Reshoring index, which includes the developed-market stocks in sectors where China is most export-dependent, has comfortably beaten the overall MSCI World:\nChina’s foreign direct investment isn’t catching any breaks either, with inflows turning negative for the first time in 25 years as money instead flows to countries like Mexico, India and Brazil. This isn’t good news for the yuan, especially with the potential for an escalation of a trade war with the US.However, nobody thinks that Beijing is going to just give up without a fight. Whether measures taken to limit the ramifications of deglobalization and develop so-called “new productive forces” are fruitful is another question. But there’s a real possibility of China making lemonade out of these lemons. Academy Securities’ Peter Tchir cites Chinese resilience:I’m worried that as we restrict things for China, it will just make them better at it. We’ve asked before how China is making so many phones with seven-nanometer chips, when there have been restrictions in place on chips thinner than 10 nanometers... China has flaws and may not be able to execute on their strategies, but I suspect that we are stuck underestimating their capabilities rather than overestimating them.China has come too far to give up. At present, markets are pricing a notion that China will slip into isolation. It’s still possible that re-shoring will prompt new competition from China — and that’s a risk that isn’t currently being priced.   —Richard Abbey\n      "

For the future, however, there was at least one idea that could make a big difference.Hunt is opening consultations on a “UK ISA” (an ISA or Individual Savings Account is broadly the British equivalent of the US Individual Retirement Account; for obvious reasons, IRA would not have been a popular set of initials in Britain). Britons can already place £20,000 in an ISA each year, an amount rarely taken up in full. The proposal would add another £5,000 yearly for a separate ISA that could only invest in UK companies. The idea is to use the tax system to boost investing in British stocks without forcing people to sell existing investments.My colleague John Stepek argues cogently that a British ISA “makes a lot of sense.” He and Merryn Somerset Webb also point out that British stocks are cheap, very cheap. It wasn’t always thus. This is how forward price/earnings multiples for the FTSE-100 and S&P 500 have moved:\nThe problem the new ISA needs to counter is that buying outside the UK is addictive. Britain’s economic troubles weaken the pound. Foreign stocks look more attractive, prompting more money out of the country, to weaken the pound further. In pounds, the relevant comparison for British investors, the S&P 500 has beaten the FTSE-100 massively over 15 years (a period that starts on the exact day of the post-Global Financial Crisis bottom):\nThe weakness of the yen has created a similar dynamic in Japan, where retail investors (nicknamed Mrs. Watanabe) park their money overseas. Japan’s stocks have done far better than Britain’s since the GFC — but that’s nothing to what yen-based investors could make in the US:\nGlobalization, by making it easier for capital to move, has created such issues in other countries. Notably South Korea, home to several world-class multinationals, nevertheless suffers a “Korea Discount,” that’s turning into a problem for national policy. A Great British ISA gives some incentive for Britons to invest at home again, and thus provide more capital where their country most needs it. There is logic to the idea that tax giveaways should be of some direct help to British taxpayers.But the problem is acute. As Points of Return covered earlier this year, UK pension funds have largely abandoned domestic stocks; while more than 50% of their investments were in stocks in 1990, that number is now below 10%. This might well make British capitalism less efficient. Company executives can’t organize capital with domestic investors, and must go further afield to foreign managers who don’t know them as well. It might have something to do with UK Plc’s frankly awful profit growth. As this chart from Absolute Strategy Research shows, the UK’s underperformance of US share prices has been bang in line with underperforming profit growth:\nThis becomes a vicious cycle as the UK represents an ever smaller share of total global market cap, making big allocations to it harder to justify. Absolute Strategy shows that the UK still made up as much as 11% of global equities 20 years ago. Now, thanks in part to the fall of the pound, it’s below 4%.  \nThe small companies sector, despite much-ballyhooed projects to build it up, has dwindled to what Absolute Strategy’s Ian Harnett calls an irrelevance. Institutions need to take huge stakes in them to make any difference to their overall performance. This dynamic impedes capital from staying in the country, and particularly from going to the kind of growing companies that might most buoy the economy:\nSo the British ISA addresses a real problem. It’s unclear that it can do much to solve it. It would be an inducement for individuals, not force them. The big money is in institutions. Prompting them back in might require more aggressive government intervention that would address the root of the problem — British companies’ inability to grow profits. A broader issue is whether this is the thin end of a dangerous wedge. A deglobalized capitalism might mean investors are closer to and more knowledgeable about the companies in which they invest. But it also involves forsaking opportunities elsewhere. With flows of capital now rather more important than flows of goods, this issue could well be the protectionism-versus-free-trade debate for our age. \n      Actively Fighting\nThere’s a reason why passive investing hoovers up ever more of investors’ cash: Active investors can’t beat them. Asking people to entrust their money to active managers, on the face of it, involves asking them to make a suboptimal investment. It’s not surprising that the quantum of equities run passively continues to rise. The current dominance of the biggest stocks only makes things worse. That’s underlined by the latest report from the Standard & Poor’s SPIVA service, which since 2001 has measured how active mutual funds compare to the S&P 500. Costs generally mean that most tend to lag the index. That’s what happened in 2023, as only 40% came in ahead of the benchmark. The last year when a majority of large-cap mutual funds bested the index was 2009:\nThese differences compound over time. Over 20 years, in all the US categories tracked by S&P, more than 90% of active funds lag their benchmark. No wonder index funds grew so popular for retirement savers. What’s surprising is that last year’s numbers weren’t worse. The S&P was very top-heavy, with performance dominated by a handful of giant stocks. That usually makes life that much harder for an active manager; if you didn’t happen to have Nvidia Corp. in your portfolio, for example, you made it much more difficult for yourself. In that regard, S&P suggests that 40% of funds managing to top the benchmark was a “benign” outcome. More intriguingly, managers appear to have started this year by throwing in their lot with the mega caps. A Bank of America analysis of the last three months suggests that a majority of large-cap managers is actually ahead of the Russell 1000 index, which is similar to the S&P 500:\nThat’s been achieved by buying in to the Magnificent Seven. As BofA commented, “Broad ownership of Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Microsoft likely helped as these stocks contributed 40% of the Russell 1000 Growth’s gains last month.” Those who picked the right stocks had the opportunity to beat the benchmark by a lot. However, it’s questionable how wide the opportunity set is for active managers to outperform. This generally depends on the degree of correlation in the market (if stocks move together, it’s harder to stand out from the crowd) and particularly dispersion — how much returns vary from each other. The greater the dispersion, the more a few good picks will help. And oddly, dispersion within the S&P 500 is a little lower than average, while correlation is also in line with the average. This isn’t a market that offers many opportunities to excel:\nThe Magnificent Seven make things tougher, as they are far from equal. Anyone benchmarked to the S&P 500 is more or less obliged to hold them, but it makes a difference which you hold. Only Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia are ahead of the Magnificent Seven index at present, with the whole group increasingly reliant on Nvidia. This chart from the Terminal, on a log scale, shows that Nvidia has now tripled since the previous market top at the end of 2021, while Tesla Inc. has more than halved. Dispersion is significant:\nAnyone who didn’t hold Nvidia at the beginning of the year will be growing uncomfortable. Thursday brought its gain in market cap for 2024 to a scarcely credible $1.08 trillion. The extra value that the market has accorded to the semiconductor company in the last 10 weeks is more than the entire current market value of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway: \nThe market might have an accurate read on Nvidia’s future growth prospects. But it’s not often that a company already so large sees an upgrade of such magnitude. After growth this stratospheric, Nvidia is bound to take a reverse before long, and reluctant buyers risk being sucked in. Meanwhile, two Magnificents — Apple Inc. and Tesla — have dropped below their 200-day moving averages, suggesting they’re in a long-term downward trend. Alphabet Inc. is close to joining them. Such dispersion creates opportunities, but also a lot of risk. Whatever moves the active community makes will then be amplified by passive funds that accept the market prices on offer. BofA also found that funds had made a big bet on long-term growth — stocks that showed consistent earnings growth over a long period. They were 30% overweight in the top quintile of stocks by this measure, which  outperformed the lowest quintile by 16 percentage points over the last year. They aren’t much exposed to high beta stocks (particularly sensitive to the overall market) or to cyclical stocks; so the painful outcome for them now would be a broad cyclical economic recovery that helped many stocks rebound. Having adapted to a narrow market, breadth might now be a problem for them. But they’re doing their best in trying circumstances. \n      Not Far From Cuts in Washington, Holding Season in Frankfurt\nFor those keeping count, Jerome Powell told Congress that the Federal Reserve was “not far” from having the necessary confidence to cut rates. Christine Lagarde lowered the European Central Bank’s forecasts for both growth and inflation for this year — and said that the ECB might have enough data to start cutting in June. This led to great excitement in stock markets; the S&P 500 set another record. But it didn’t come across as that big a deal for the markets most directly affected by central banking decisions. Overnight index swaps suggest that the market’s expected policy rates by the end of this year barely changed, and remain significantly higher than when the year started:\nLagarde’s great issue was European wage rises, too fast for the ECB’s comfort. And, within a few hours of your reading this, the US will have the non-farm payroll data for February to digest. A clear slowing of the labor market would definitely improve the chances of rate cuts by summer, although a cut at this month’s meeting seems out of the question.Why did two non-committal central bankers confirming what everyone had already assumed provide such a tonic for equities? It’s partly that US stocks have momentum. Further, there appear to be fewer tail risks at present, and we’re in the unusual position where central banks and investors are on the same  page. This helps investor confidence. Now to see if an aberrant payroll number messes that up. \n      "

        "content": "        Powell conspicuously declined to warn of any chance of rate hikes The Fed’s Beige Book lived up to its name; suggests rate cuts possible lat\n      Today’s Points: \n\t Powell conspicuously declined to warn of any chance of rate hikes\tThe Fed’s Beige Book lived up to its name; suggests rate cuts possible later this year\tBut the dollar had a bad day; probably relief about Powell’s message on hikes, rather than a breakout\t China’s economic targets impressed domestic investors, not foreigners\tBeijing’s emphasis on avoiding a crisis is also good for risk sentiment everywhere\tTIP: Avoid the sad fate of  Paul Gascoigne\n      Humdrum Humphrey-Hawkins\nWe have our story straight and we’re sticking with it. In the US, rates will probably come down this year, but not yet, and they almost certainly won’t rise. As for the data, it’s consistent with that, but nothing is guaranteed.A year ago, Jerome Powell of the Federal Reserve used his biannual testimony to Congress, still generally known as the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, to spark a sharp rise in bond yields that drove the sudden implosion of several large regional banks. When he spoke Tuesday, the outcome could scarcely have been more different. He stuck to  the script, saying that the fed funds rate was “likely at its peak for this tightening cycle” while adding that it would “likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year” if the economy evolved broadly as expected. He assiduously  avoided creating any news in his answers to hours of congressional questions.Then came the latest installment of employment data. Non-farm payrolls are due on Friday, always a stress point, and now the statistics on vacancies, only just updated to the end of January, suggest that the labor market is performing almost exactly as the Fed might hope. The rate of quitting is back to normal, while vacancies continue to fall after hitting extremes in the pandemic’s aftermath.\nThese didn’t suggest any urgency for the Fed to cut rates, but perhaps more importantly suggested almost no need to hike. As this data, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, had provided an early warning of the inflation spike, it’s now  closely watched. Lightcast Senior Economist Ron Hetrick suggested that “the labor market is back to its pre-pandemic normal, but normal feels different than it used to.” He suggested workers’ grim perceptions were because they had “experienced something completely unrealistic in ’21 and ’22.”The JOLTS followed Tuesday’s supply manager survey of the services sector that also moved in exactly the right direction to avert any risk of higher interest rates. After surprisingly strong readings a month earlier, businesses reported that both the prices they paid, and their employment, were falling back again:\nAnother opportunity to frame the debate came with publication of the Beige Book, the Fed’s regular collation of anecdotal evidence on the economy from its regional branches. The bottom line was that economic activity had “increased slightly, on balance, since early January.” Consumer spending, however, “inched down” while demand for loans was “stable to down” — which might suggest cuts. But there was no sign that disruptions in the  Red Sea and Panama Canal had had any great effect on prices. On the key issue of whether there’s a risk of a wage-price spiral, the Beige Book averred that “employee expectations of pay adjustments were more in line with historical averages.” Bloomberg’s Cameron Crise, writer of the daily Macro Man column, commented caustically that if you’d had access only to the Beige Book over the past year, “you’d have thought that the Fed would have cut 100-200 basis points by now.” As the data in that time haven’t matched the anecdotes reported in beige and white, he suggested that “the report probably shouldn’t be the basis of any trading decisions.” In a more positive spin, Oxford Economics’s regular index derived from the book’s word choices found that the Fed’s bankers were detecting a pick-up in activity:\nAll of this added up to general reassurance that markets had had their story straight on the strength of the economy already, with no need to adjust — and therefore a rather quiet day for US stocks and bonds, both of which saw muted gains in price. However, rather peculiarly, that was balanced by an emphatic decline for the dollar, which had its worst day of the year. The dollar index, a popular measure of performance compared to other industrialized countries, startlingly dropped below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, in what market technicians might describe as a clear breakout.\nWhat exactly could explain such a big move? Perhaps rate differentials — higher yields in one currency will tend to attract international funds and drive an appreciation. A fall in expected future rates would therefore naturally tend to weaken the dollar. The hitch is that the fed funds futures market barely budged Wednesday. Nothing Powell said was seen as moving the needle.  What might be at work, instead, is the steady narrowing of tail risks. Last month, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told Bloomberg’s Wall Street Week that there was “a meaningful chance — maybe it’s 15% — that the next move is going to be upwards in rates, not downwards.” Surprisingly strong inflation numbers similarly fanned worries that the market might not even be right about the direction fed funds will take next. Humphrey-Hawkins has in the past frequently served as a pulpit to announce a big potential change. The fact that Powell totally eschewed it therefore becomes very meaningful.Rather than a breakout, the dollar may be falling on what Marc Chandler of Bannockburn Global Forex describes as a “Summers echo in the market.” That is, the dollar has merely returned to the middle of its range now that the Fed has been convincing about the most likely interest rate path. Or, as Jean Ergas, chief economist of Tigress Financial Partners LLC in New York, puts it, “The worst case scenario has been taken off the table.” It wasn’t considered probable before, but it’s great to receive that reassurance. The sharpness of the dollar’s descent also owed something to Thursday’s looming  European Central Bank meeting, and particularly the non-farm payrolls data coming on Friday. Traders don’t want to head into big set-piece events like this in too exposed a position. It’s now time to enjoy the shows in Frankfurt and New York.   \n    China guards 5%. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg\n      Two Sessions\nChina’s economic reemergence from the pandemic has been sluggish. Last year’s 5% growth rate merely papered over the cracks of much deeper problems that have kept Beijing and investors alike on edge. Long-brewing troubles in the property sector culminated in  China Evergrande's failure. Understandably, the stock market fared no better and was one of the worst-performing in the last year.Questions about whether authorities still have enough firepower to jump-start the economy were begging for answers ahead of  Premier Li Qiang's first work report submission to the National People’s Congress — a forum the leadership traditionally uses to announce new policies. Instead, Li opted for continuity, preferring spending increases to tax cuts, for stimulus this year, and aiming for growth of “about 5%.” That implies an acceptance that growth won’t shoot back to the rates that were typical before the Global Financial Crisis, or even in the years leading up to the pandemic:\nThis splurge will come from issuing 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) in so-called “ultra-long special treasury bonds” intended to “implement major national strategies and build up security capacity in key areas.” Gavekal Research's Wei He sees most of the bond proceeds ending up in infrastructure projects (a model from which Beijing had hoped to evolve). He said:The stepped-up fiscal support means infrastructure investment is likely to post double-digit growth this year, following the 8.2% expansion in 2023. That should help to put the economy on course to reach the growth target, even if organic growth drivers remain lackluster.People are most likely to argue that the infrastructure drive is the  central government’s way of using its balance sheet to support economic growth. If that were the case, it would potentially ease the burden on local governments, many of which are grappling with off-balance-sheet debt strains. But are the measures contained in Li's outline sufficient confidence boosters? The response is mixed. The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index's recovery in the past few days suggests positivity, but Capital Economics’s Thomas Matthews argues that authorities will need to do more to sustain the rally:Despite the ambitious “around five percent” GDP growth target announcement, we're skeptical that authorities are planning enough fiscal and monetary stimulus to accelerate growth all that much (although they are planning some). For the equity market, that means we see little reason to expect the anemic earnings picture of the “non-tech” parts of the market to turn any time soon. The S&P China ADR Index of American-listed Chinese companies offers a contrasting picture of sentiment. Judging by the gauge’s performance since Li's outline, US investors are  anything but convinced in the recovery efforts:\nState-owned enterprises have underpinned the performance of the MSCI China Index, appealing to investors seeking ROE. Bank of America's analysts, led by Winnie Wu, see a continuation of this outperformance, given SOEs’ enhanced focus on shareholder returns and financial discipline. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, foreign exchange strategist at the Bank of Singapore, said that the 2024 economic targets “still show officials are unwilling to quickly reflate the economy given concerns about excessive debt and the weakness of the yuan.”Regardless, there’s a consensus that an increased role for the private sector — which has suffered a government clampdown in recent years — will be vital to unlocking foreign investment. Matthews notes that Beijing’s assurances to reduce obstacles for the private sector might not be enough: Investors and private firms are likely to need  more than a change in tone. There’s a fundamental tension between pledges to respect market outcomes and strategic goals of raising resilience and self-sufficiency.China’s story is far from over. Authorities have an arduous task of preventing fiscal slippages while embarking on policies that foster growth, if possible in the near term, to recover some of the losses inflicted by the pandemic. No doubt there will be pain. The overall outcome of this long march will be determined by dedication and discipline.  —Richard Abbey\n      "

The digital asset almost immediately retreated, having topped the ceiling set over two years ago, but that seems to matter little. What’s more interesting is whether the underlying fundamentals in this bullish run are sustainable and ushering the asset into a new era, or whether it’s based on fear of missing out.A fair amount of Bitcoin skepticism is rooted in its bust-to-boom cycle. The bullish run that sent it to record heights in November 2021 was primarily fueled by excess cash doled out to cushion against the pandemic’s impact. The post-pandemic peak didn’t last long, with the digital asset plunging by nearly 80% in 2022 as central banks hiked interest rates. A raft of scandals, led by the collapse of the FTX exchange, didn’t help. But the largest cryptocurrency's latest meteoric rise has a different twist. Bitcoin’s comeback since early 2023 has lifted the overall market value of digital assets to about $2.6 trillion. And in the eight weeks since the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved exchange-traded funds, paving the way for BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments to venture into the space, Bitcoin has shot up by about 50%. Put together, these funds have recorded about $8 billion in net inflows, adding to bullish sentiment.\nThe question of whether Bitcoin has finally attained the legitimacy that its enthusiasts have long craved now becomes more urgent. Frnt Financial Inc.’s Stephane Ouellette believes that from a top-down standpoint, the entire narrative of why Bitcoin was formed is playing out. He attributes several reasons to its increasing popularity as a safe asset: From regional banking troubles in the US earlier in the year to an extreme amount of currency crises globally, post-Covid, there’s generally a distrust for establishment organizations and a slow realization that Bitcoin provides some insulation to these forces. Cult-like Bitcoin followers have been accumulating BTC through the period.Further evidence that Bitcoin’s resurgence owes much to growing demand for safe assets comes from gold. Although gold ETFs have seen outflows as money poured instead into the new Bitcoin vehicles, it also hit a new record Tuesday — and stayed there. \nGold’s new high, made after repeated failures to breach $2,100 over the past four years, looks like a significant breakout and suggests genuine appetite for investments seen as a store of value. That makes it unwise to dismiss the crypto record. It’s a far less tested asset than gold, but it is perceived, correctly or otherwise, to offer much the same qualities. How high can Bitcoin rise? It’s hard to tell at this point. It might be clearer whether this is all froth in a few weeks, with the widely anticipated reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth known as halving — which should be another bullish factor. But could the impact of the halving be exaggerated? Ouellette believes “that the reduction in the block reward size is immaterial next to liquidity of the asset. However, the event has clearly become a psychological flashpoint.”The Frnt chart below shows BTC price rallying into and out of previous halvings, which tended to come at points when prices had been stable for a while. Ouellette argues that a similar chart pattern is playing out now. It shouldn’t be surprising, with Bitcoin as nascent as it is, that you see relatively simplistic and raw technical patterns play out:\nThe daily sentiment index among futures traders shows more evidence of possible froth in Bitcoin’s price. Miller Tabak + Co’s Matt Maley argues that the measure’s 88% return on bullishness on Monday indicates that the asset is extremely overbought, a notion that might have been confirmed by the sharp reversal immediately after the new record price was set:When any asset gets as overbought and over-loved as Bitcoin has become recently, it tends to see a decent pullback. However, the Bitcoin bulls should actually welcome this decline. Once it works off some of this near-term euphoria over a week or more, it will be in a better position to break above its old highs.  Bitcoin’s previous bust-to-boom cycles provide plenty of fodder for skeptics; but it’s fair to note that this continues a pattern in which Bitcoin forms what looks like a classic bubble that bursts — only to surge to a new high a few years later. Such a pattern cannot carry on indefinitely, but it does suggest that there could be more speculative life in it. Add to this a new source of demand that didn’t exist two months ago, from institutional investors using ETFs, and it’s not surprising that Bitcoin has yet again completed its rise from the dead.— Richard Abbey\n      Momentum Behind Momentum\nAnother explanation, which   Points of Return has lately covered several times, is that the return of speculative excitement to Bitcoin is a sign of a generalized bubble that has also inflated in the stock market. Gold’s record undermines this notion a bit, as it suggests some very real caution primarily driven at present by worries about unsustainable fiscal spending. But the signs of overheating are there.Looking at the internal movement of the stocks within the main S&P 500 index, it’s interesting to see a pattern recur from the greatest US bubble, from 1999 and early 2000. This chart from the UBS HOLT service shows how  factors performed  during the last two years of that epic melt-up:\nGlobally, but particularly in the US, momentum — buying stocks that have recently been winning and selling or shorting those that have been losing — worked fantastically. Growth — buying stocks with growing earnings — also did well, and was far superior to value investing. The current rally has something in common with this; after failing to deliver for much of the time since successful Covid-19 vaccine test results turned the market around in November 2020, momentum is on a surge for the ages:\nNote that when the Magnificent Seven big internet platforms began to emerge as the defining investing theme in early 2023,  momentum had a terrible time. Those stocks had been sold aggressively, and their big reversal hurt momentum traders. This time is different.Meanwhile, if we look at quality (generally defined as buying companies with strong balance sheets and consistent earnings) and growth, it’s intriguing that neither has done that well on a global scale. Nobody had much interest in quality during the pandemic, while for the last two years, the factor oscillated between small gains and losses. The same is true of growth stocks, which previously had enjoyed a great surge in the later months of 2020 and then throughout 2021. The following chart, drawn from the Bloomberg Factors To Watch function, shows the returns from buying the best 20% of stocks according to a  factor, while shorting the worst 20%, to give a pure measure of the returns that can be attributed specifically to it.\nAs is well known, and might be expected during a speculative bubble, value stocks are having a bad time — although most dramatically in the US. This decade, large-cap value stocks have underperformed growth by about 33%. In the rest of the developed world, the effect is much more muted, with an underperformance of a little more than 10%:\nThe silver lining, if you’re a value investor, is that you can now buy really, really cheap, compared to the rest of the market. By definition value stocks trade at a lower multiple than others. But the gap in valuation is growing extreme. The following chart from the Boston fund management group GMO shows the gap between value and the rest based on a blend of metrics. Value has never been cheaper than in 1999 and 2000 — and on that occasion, the discount narrowed dramatically after the dot-com bubble, delivering great returns for those value investors who were still in business. At the end of the worst phase of the pandemic, the value discount thus measured was as deep as it had been since then. Value staged a recovery as the arrival of vaccines brought back optimism, but the discount is now approaching its 2000 lows. While a bubble is going on, value is a miserable place to be. But by GMO’s calculations, value globally “still needs to outperform growth by 50% to 60% for relative valuations to return to long-term averages.” That leads them to counsel patience and investing in value stocks that will eventually benefit:\nBut are there impediments to the correction that GMO eventually expects, and just why is value doing quite so badly in the US? Savita Subramanian, Bank of America’s very influential equity strategist, yesterday suggested a new answer: index funds. Without entering into the argument over whether big passive funds inflate bubbles (they certainly do nothing to deflate them), she pointed to a less widely known effect when it comes to reinvesting dividends.When index funds are held for retirement, clients generally opt to have dividend income reinvested. That reinvestment isn’t proportional to the dividends a company paid out, but rather to market cap. Thus, the process acts at the margin to transfer money away from high dividend-payers (which by definition tend to be value stocks), and into larger companies that pay few or no dividends. Reinvesting this way puts a thumb on the scale in favor of growth and against value. At present, that also strengthens the momentum that’s already ongoing.  Timing a bubble is a dangerous game. But if you want to try it, piling in to momentum has its appeal. Yes, that will tend to make the speculative excess that much worse, but for the moment, it’s hard to resist. For those who can genuinely stash money away for a decade or more, value looks appealing. \n    Munch’s ‘The Scream,’ aka the Super Tuesday TV coverage.

So let’s return to the topic, yet again. And to be clear about the terms, we’re not asking whether the market is too cheap, or whether corporate fundamentals will improve to support further gains. We’re simply asking: Will this market keep going up? That requires a judgment on individual behavior and group dynamics. Valuation, for the possible melt-up of the next few months, is beside the point.SentimentThe consensus view is that bullishness is in the ascendant, but not to the extent seen in earlier bubbles. A popular long-running metric is the American Association of Individual Investors’ weekly survey of members, asking if they’re feeling bullish, bearish or neither. The greatest majority of bears over bulls came in the exact week in March 2009 that the S&P 500 hit bottom after the Global Financial Crisis. It’s not quite so good at signaling tops, but the current level confirms bulls are in the majority without suggesting an unambiguous bubble: \nCapitulationMore or less everyone was surprised by the non-arrival of a recession last year, and they continue to be surprised by US robustness now. That forces the strategists for big sell-side firms, who tend to be influential, either to revise their forecasts for the end of this year upward, or to predict a fall between now and then. For example, the following chart was published by the Goldman Sachs equity strategy team in January. It showed the projected path to the target of 5,100 on the S&P 500 by Dec. 31. As we know, the S&P 500 has already got there. This is relevant new information, and prompted Goldman’s team, one of the most powerful on Wall Street, to increase their year-end estimate to 5,200. They’ve also made clear that   they don’t think this is, as yet, a bubble:\nSavita Subramanian of Bank of America Corp., another of Wall Street’s most influential strategists, announced that her year-end target was rising from 5,000 to 5,400. But she did this in circumscribed terms, saying “our bullish conviction has cooled since publishing our 2024 Outlook,” thanks to “improving sentiment across Wall Street,” which is now strong enough to suggest that BofA’s call should now be neutral. But, she added, “a neutral call is rarely correct” (the stock market generally goes up a lot, punctuated by selloffs, rather than making steady increases), so that the net message from her market-timing tools was “still, in one word, UP.” Her view on sentiment was as follows:Bull markets end with euphoria. The Sell Side has grown more bullish on equities as highlighted above, but pension fund allocations to public equity are still at 20-year lows, and positioning in up-market themes like high beta stocks and cyclical sectors is at bearish extremes. Areas of euphoria are thematic and secular. We expect the market to broaden beyond these themes, but caution that passive inflows could drive continued momentum in US growth/mega-cap stocks.When strategists move their calls, they generally bring some cash with them, adding to the pressure on others to capitulate. According to the latest regular tally of official strategist targets kept by colleague Lu Wang, the average year-end forecast is now 4,915, implying a fall of a little over 3% for the S&P over the next 10 months. Others will feel the pressure to rise.Beyond the strategists, there’s even more of a boost to sentiment when the most redoubtable bears capitulate. Nouriel Roubini, the economist famous for correctly predicting the GFC, has now turned positive and said in  his appearance on Bloomberg Surveillance that the economy might enjoy a “no-landing” scenario. To quote Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz: The fact that Roubini, who is known for his gloom, can’t find much negativity in the US economy sends a pretty strong message at a time when the S&P 500 is hitting record high after record high. It’s the reason we’ve already seen so many upgrades to strategists’ S&P targets for year-end, despite high valuations.LiquidityBubbles, in both physical and market forms, are liquid phenomena. More liquidity available to investors will mean they spend it on something. If they buy stocks, as is often the case, then valuations can start to surge. Mike Howell of CrossBorder Capital in London measures speculation by dividing market capitalization by  liquidity. The more liquidity there is, the more stocks will naturally tend to rise. What should be worrying is when stocks take up an ever greater share of available money. That implies the final mania stage has arrived.It isn’t here yet, at least as long as money is fungible and the S&P 500 benefits from global liquidity and not just money created in the US. This is the long-term relationship between the S&P and Howell’s measure of world liquidity. It’s startlingly close:\nLooking at net inflows to the dollar from abroad since the turn of the century, we get an inkling as to why the US has outperformed the rest of the world so convincingly since the GFC. Previous outflows turned into huge net inflows to the dollar. The growing problems with the Chinese economic model, in particular, seem to have spurred this: \nHowell sums up as follows:The S&P 500 looks extended in absolute terms when measured by US domestic liquidity flows, but it looks far more comfortably placed when Global Liquidity is the benchmark. Plainly, US equities have got much further to run if we can reassure ourselves that Wall Street has become the ‘World market’ for stocks. Indeed, this might be plausible given the dominance of US firms in tech and AI-applications?The corollary is that anything that halts the flows into the US (such as change of course by the Bank of Japan or some intensification of the trade war) could imperil the bubble. That hasn’t happened, yet. His conclusion: Stay invested.The MacroThe bigger picture points to the kind of calm that can propagate bubbles. If stability begets instability (as proposed by the economist  Hyman Minsky), then conditions look set fair for the market to go further. The Fathom Risk-Off Gauge (or FROG) in the chart below, calculated by London’s Fathom Consulting, incorporates changes in the macro cycle, market liquidity, and the correlation between bond and equity markets to derive a probability that markets are in a “risk-off” regime (in which bonds are favored over stocks). At this point, all looks set fair:\nRatesA move to make money cheaper has lit the touch paper for several explosions of past speculation. Several rate cuts are still, of course, expected before the end of this year. But much depends on whether they prove to be merited. As this chart from James Reilly of Capital Economics demonstrates, cuts that are not quickly followed by a recession tend almost invariably to push the stock market higher over the next year. When they’re followed by a recession, then in general they cannot save the stock market from a loss:\nThere’s no particular evidence that lowering rates into a slowing economy would do much to boost share prices. Cuts when the economy is OK are different; the cuts in late 1998 after the Russian default and the meltdown of Long-Term Capital Management were followed by a 38% gain. This time, Fed rate cuts aren’t “a necessary condition for the stock market bubble to inflate further,” says Reilly. “After all, most measures of equity risk premia have scope to fall as hype around AI grows.” And, he points out, this stock market rally has gained strength even as bond yields have rebounded higher. That might well be because the Fed’s pivot late last year has already done the job. Ed Cole of Man Group in London suggests that what has changed to allow stock prices to rise so fast is that the Fed “signaled a change in its  reaction function,” so that is symmetrical again, rather than strongly focused on bringing inflation down. That has been interpreted as a sign that the Fed “has our back again” and will even tolerate a bubble. And, he points out, financial conditions have already responded dramatically by getting much easier. Following Bloomberg’s financial conditions index, the backdrop has grown more lenient even as rate expectations have grown more hawkish: \nOne final point worth making is that the Fed doesn’t have a history of allowing a strong equity market to deter it from cutting. As this chart from Citi shows, the majority of rate-cutting cycles start with the S&P 500 above its 200-day moving average. It’s true that the Fed tends to cut by less in total if the stock market is strong at the outset, but that’s not an issue for this year:\nComing to MarketThe IPO market gives a great clue as to whether  exuberance has become irrational. Generally, newly floated companies don’t perform well for their first year or two, but investors still clamor to get a stake. Nicholas Colas of DataTrek International suggests this makes the level of excess on IPO days a great measure of whether sentiment is truly bubbly. Thus, in 1999, the 476 IPOs (a record) saw an average first-day gain of 71% (a record by a massive margin, as this number had never before reached 25%). As Colas put it: “Scarcity value doesn’t explain the first day moves. Irrational exuberance does.” In the post-pandemic bubble of 2020 and 2021, the average first day gains were 42% and 32%. There were 311 IPOs in 2021, the most since the top of the previous bubble in 2000. Last year, by comparison, saw only 54 IPOs with an average first-day gain of 12%. This market rally is about paying, perhaps overpaying, for quality. ValuationFinally, a necessary word of caution. Valuation is more or less irrelevant when trying to predict the next year, but it’s everything you need to know to predict the next decade. That’s only a slight exaggeration. Subramanian’s note raising her target for 2023 also included this chart looking at price/earnings ratios compared to subsequent 10-year returns. The correlation is above 80%:\nFollowing this to its conclusion, there is powerful reason to believe that the next 10 years won’t be very good. As there’s also pretty good reason, as we’ve seen, to expect share prices to rise healthily for a while longer. The implication is that after this rally, or bubble, reaches a peak, the market is set to go down for a while. The logic that might lead you to jump in to a potentially forming bubble will also require you to keep looking over your shoulder to decide when to sell.— Assisted by Richard Abbey\n      "

The digital asset has removed gold’s shine by climbing more than 40% since Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched amid much hype in January. Not just that, their inflows appear to have come at the expense of gold ETFs, which have had net outflows.\nHowever, gold’s price remains strong — so much so that it closed Friday at yet another all-time high. If it’s not attracted much attention, that’s because gold has come close to $2,100 per ounce   several times since the pandemic. All the apparent breakouts (including one early last December when the price briefly exceeded $2,100) fizzled quickly.\nCould this time be different? The key ingredient for a sustained rally would be clarity that interest rates are heading down. Gold is regarded as a hedge against central bank fecklessness. Its earlier flirtations with $2,100 came at points when rate cuts appeared to be in the offing. As recent data have shown mixed signals on inflation, that conviction has dwindled. Regardless, the overwhelming expectation of the Federal Reserve’s next action is a cut rather than a hike (for the contrary view, read on below). The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next week and parse the data since January. A rate cut in March is not part of the equation, as the data seem too strong to allow it. What matters is whether there’s enough evidence to warrant loosening later in the year. Tracking gold since the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge last Thursday shows a renewed optimism on rate cuts. The shiny metal’s price has an inverse relationship with interest rates, and rose as the core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index came in no higher than expectations. While the PCE is still too high for the Fed’s liking, and can’t be taken as the smoking gun that inflation is beaten, it boosted hopes of a cut later this year:\nBefore the PCE release, gold prices were muted. Investors might play it safe as they await clues on rates; but there’s also the risk of waiting too long. What could be fueling this inertia? The answer lies in a raft of previous missteps from relying on indicators such as real rates or the broad dollar, TD Securities’ Daniel Ghali explained in  this interview with Seeking Alpha. Having burnt their fingers in the past, gold investors are exercising caution by remaining underweight and instead choosing to build a sizable net short position with prices at all-time highs, Ghali says. And why might that be the case? “There are moments in time where large changes in real rates don’t really have much of an impact on gold,” he says. “That’s happening today.”Other analysts suggest that the positioning for a gold fall makes this a good time to increase exposure. Longview Economics’s Harry Colvin says that much of the “frothiness” evident last December has unwound with gold consolidating its gains/trending sideways:The risk reward, therefore, favors starting to increase gold exposure in strategic portfolios for four key reasons. In particular: (i) our gold ‘market timing model’ has unwound its SELL signal; (ii) gold put protection is high; (iii) Fed cuts are likely to be ‘priced back’ into the rates market later this year; and (iv) key actors continue to hoard physical gold.\nAs far as risks go, the Fed’s insistence on assurance that inflation is headed back to 2% could yet result in stagflation — which produced history’s greatest bubble in gold prices at the end of the 1970s. While SSGA’s Michael Arone says the phenomenon has a low probability, he urges investors to “consider a diversified investment allocation to real assets that may help to ease the pain from that outcome.”Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone suggests upward gold prices are likely, but adds that investors combine it with some Bitcoin or otherwise risk falling behind potential paradigm-shifting digitalization trends. As it is, gold’s rally in recent days points toward general optimism over monetary loosening. The resilient US stock market, strong currency, and 5% interest rates are headwinds for gold; so a further rally would be helped by an equity bubble and subsequent burst, and rate cuts. Now, how likely are they?—Richard Abbey\n  Double, Bubble, Toil and Trouble…\nIs there a stock market bubble? The S&P 500 rose above 5,100 for the first time to end the week. But the more persuasive evidence came from The Economist. Business magazine covers are notoriously good contrarian indicators, so this one provoked plenty of interest:\nThis immediately followed Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most influential investors, publishing a piece titled Are We in a Stock Market Bubble? His answer was “not yet.” Old friend James Mackintosh came to the same conclusion  in the Wall Street Journal. That so many are asking the question might show awareness of the risks, so we cannot be in the final bubble stages yet. It’s also fair to argue that The Economist cover captures a belief that this rally in stocks is being levitated solely by hot air — in which case, if it’s a contrarian indicator, it could even be a bullish one. But it’s noticeable how many people suggest that a bubble is forming, and that this isn’t one yet. To quote Peter Atwater of Financial Insyghts, a veteran sentiment-watcher:With Dalio and now Mackintosh concluding, “It’s not a bubble YET,” we could soon see a rush of cash into the market. Nothing creates a bubble like the crowd’s simultaneous and collective belief that a bubble is still yet to come. Still, I can’t help but wonder if Mr. Dalio and Mr. Mackintosh have just said the quiet part aloud. It’s hard to look at the stock price of Nvidia without thinking that everyone already thinks the best is yet to come.What are the arguments that this isn’t a bubble thus far? Valuation was much more overdone just three years ago, peaking during the meme stock madness. As the chart shows, the Magnificent Seven stocks and the Nasdaq 100 were far more extended then than now. Nothing as absurd is around at present, with excitement conservatively centered on the biggest companies with the biggest profits. If we use trailing price/earnings as a gauge, the Magnificent Seven are much more closely aligned with the broader market than three years ago — and the S&P 500, on an equal-weighted basis, still looks very much cheaper:\nAnother argument that we’re not there is in the relatively subdued amounts of margin debt. Several readers have pointed out that options activity, particularly in the form of ODTE options that effectively bet on one day’s performance, could be creating more leverage. Dalio suggests otherwise. Single stock option volume in calls (betting on stocks to go up) has recently risen sharply. It’s still nowhere near the heights reached during the meme stock bubble:\nIn the Magnificent Seven, options activity looks plum average. For all the excitement and money that the Magnificents are creating, the numbers trying to bet on them with options are unexceptional:\nIf a bubble is forming, it might not be directly visible in financial market prices. Many standard measures suggest the market is not as overblown now as three years ago, let alone at the top of the dot-com bubble in 2000. The exception is the multiple of sales at which the tech companies are trading, now at an all-time high:\nIf multiples of revenue have increased this much, it suggests great confidence in profit margins. Several of the tech giants have delivered impressive results of late, which brook no argument. If there’s a bubble, it might be in the profitability that Big Tech is currently recording.   Is it really sustainable? For the time being, however, the view is that a bubble is forming, and has further to go. The greatest risk to it comes from rates:\n      Will the Fed Cut Rates This Year?\nBubble scenarios tend to be built on rate cuts — cheaper money has been a vital catalyst for history’s investment bubbles. Both the Fed and the fed funds futures market currently expect three rate cuts this year. But what if the Fed doesn’t cut at all? Torsten Slok, chief economist at the Apollo Group in New York, had the nerve to put his head over the parapet and   predict that they won’t. All of his arguments are based in the economics. I summarize as follows:\tThe economy isn’t slowing down, it’s reaccelerating. The Fed’s “pivot” toward lower rates in December eased financial conditions (without the central bank doing anything).  \tUnderlying   measures of trend inflation are moving higher.\t Supercore inflation is rising.\tThe labor market remains tight, jobless claims are low, and wage inflation is sticky between 4% and 5%.\tSmall businesses say they’re planning to raise selling prices and workers’ pay.\tManufacturing and services ISM surveys show a higher trend in prices paid.\tAsking rents are rising again, as are home prices.\tFinancial conditions are easing. This is a pretty cogent list. I’d add that politics (the later they wait, the harder it is to cut as the election approaches), and the Fed’s natural desire to avoid repeating historic mistakes (cutting too soon led to more inflation in the 1970s, and to the bubble at the end of the 1990s) stack the deck further against cuts. It’s possible that the   very startling Powell pivot was an ingenious attempt to loosen conditions without taking great reputational risk of starting the cutting process. This year has 10 more months to run. If the labor market and inflation data start to turn, and particularly if there is a financial crisis of some kind, then the picture changes again and we can expect cuts. But I think Slok is right that at this point, it’s not clear we should expect any cuts at all. Which would be bad for the gold price, but might also help head off a bubble. \n    A-Rod steps up to the podcast. Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg\n      "

It saw  release of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) measure of inflation, which regularly comes out some weeks after the better known Consumer Price Index (CPI). Both measure the same thing in different ways, so the CPI should be a reliable indicator. But recently,  the gap between them has widened; the PCE, which measures what people are spending, shows lower inflation than the CPI, which measures the prices at which things are being sold. The CPI number for January was disappointingly high, and PCE was expected to tick up. So there was apprehension.                                    In the event, the number wasn’t good, but could have been worse. Headline PCE was 2.4% year on year, while core inflation was 2.8%, both lower than in December and in line with expectation. The internals were problematic, residing in what the Federal Reserve calls the “Supercore,” services inflation excluding property. This escapes the excitement around goods prices that rocketed during the pandemic, along with the measurement difficulties that come with real estate prices. If we assume that Supercore gives us the truest measure of underlying inflationary pressure, it wasn’t encouraging. January saw its biggest month-on-month increase in a year, while the measure also ticked up slightly on a year-on-year basis. It’s only one month, but it’s not good:\nAlternatively, the Fed’s statisticians set great store by the trimmed mean, which excludes the biggest outlying components in either direction, and takes the average of the rest. That ensures that the measure can’t be skewed by a few extreme price moves in isolated segments. Again, unfortunately, the news here is not good. The chart shows both month-on-month inflation (annualized to show how much inflation would be if it carried on at this rate for a year), and year on year. The year-on-year measure is still declining, but a bit too  high for comfort; while month on month, January saw a sharp acceleration:\nThere may be some kind of January effect at work, as this measure spiked high in both the last two Januaries, but it’s still not good to see.Delving further into the weeds, the biggest issue is with the price of professional services, whose measurement is contentious. If the market goes up, then the charge for buying a mutual fund will also rise, for example. But the rises in lawyers’ fees are harder to explain away. There’s also a continuing increase in the price to go and see sport, a business that was particularly affected by Covid. And non-prescription drugs inflation is running at 11% year on year, possibly in response to the Inflation Reduction Act’s move to limit prescription drug raises (0.4%): \nDiana Iovanel of Capital Economics suggests that while “supercore” rose last month, “that was mainly due to outsized gains in portfolio management prices and medical care services, which we think was an anomaly.” That certainly seems to be a possibility, and would suggest that inflation, and bond yields, can come down further over the rest of this year. Meanwhile, the numbers do confirm that the extreme price shocks that came in the wake of the pandemic are over. Gas and oil, and eggs (which had inflation of above 60% at one point) and car rentals, are all now actively deflating. Other categories continue to decline year on year as technology replaces them; calculators and typewriters are deflating at more than 10%, as are televisions (after a brief supply chain-driven spike after the pandemic):\nWhen people say that the official numbers are out of kilter with their lived experience, they’re almost certainly right. Variations in prices are huge. But the numbers for services, which tend to be driven by wages, remain impossible to ignore.What Does Any of This Even Mean?Perhaps the single clearest message from looking at the breakdown is that any attempt to measure overall inflation within the economy is going to be fraught with difficulty, and rest on disputable assumptions. That is good to know because both society and the markets are riven by disputes over inflation technicalities. Plenty of people believe the figures are manipulated or even falsified, while the overall numbers can seem to ignore realities for particular individuals on the ground. No two humans will buy the same basket of things each month, so they’ll tend to have slightly different rates of inflation in their living costs. For a handy primer on exactly what the CPI and the PCE mean, I recommend   this Odds Lots podcast in which Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway interrogate Omair Sharif, founder and president of Inflation Insights, and Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, on the differences between the two measures and what they tell us. You could also try my interview with Emi Nakamura, an economist now at the University of California at Berkeley and inflation expert, from six years ago; it remains relevant.\n    A housing development, in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Photographer: Rachel Wisniewski/Bloomberg\nThe single most contentious area is how to account for housing. For those who already own a house, price appreciation is good and increases your buying power, making it deceptively difficult to factor into calculations. Rental properties come with a clearly defined price, but one that doesn’t change more than once a year — and of course rents can move very differently depending on what kind of accommodation is on offer, and where it is. Most would agree that the official numbers understated property inflation in 2021, when overall inflation was beginning to take off, and overstate it now. But the matter is confusing at the best of times, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics muddied the waters further this week with an email that has since been retracted. Its point was to alert economists to a rise in weighting for single-family detached homes when calculating owner-equivalent rent. Given the angst over housing this could be significant, but Sharif called it a “tempest in a teapot.” A similar re-weighting happened a year ago, and had no discernible effect.What Does This Mean for the Fed?People care about the PCE because the Fed does. It’s the central bank’s preferred measure, which it targets. Falls in PCE last year were a major exhibit in the case that rates would need to drop quickly. Now, this latest PCE appears to have confirmed the belief that rate cuts cannot start until June at the earliest. It’s  harder for the Fed to cut than it appears, and impossible without clear evidence that  inflation is already headed back toward its target. Other factors are arrayed against cuts. The central bank doesn’t want to take the blame for a stock market bubble. Its incentives are skewed heavily toward avoiding the embarrassment of cutting too soon and seeing inflation take off again as happened in the 1970s, and the closer the election approaches, the greater the danger that any cut will be denounced as a  political move to help President Joe Biden. With the economy apparently humming along, it’s hard to say that cuts are necessary.\n    The Fed can’t be seen to be helping Biden, pictured above at the border.  Photographer: Eddie Seal/Bloomberg\nIndeed, the possibility of further rate increases can’t be ruled out totally, a point made by Steven Blitz of TS Lombard:In the FOMC's January minutes, they assured themselves that 5.5% is the peak for this cycle. January personal income and price data offer evidence that their self-assurance might be misplaced. If the economy continues to expand apace (wage and salary disbursements, chiefly), there is little chance for service inflation to decelerate further and for goods prices to keep deflating (CPI goods ex food & energy turned up in January). As he shows, last month’s rise in core PCE, when annualized, was almost equivalent to the current fed funds rate. While the January jump was so sharp that it may well be proved something of a flash in the pan, it would be hard for the Fed to allow its target rate to drop below the inflation rate. Another tick up in inflation could conceivably oblige a hike once more:\nAnd the Markets?This data release was pre-hyped as a big event. The surprisingly strong CPI earlier in the month raised the stakes. That number, in combination with predictions (which turned out to be correct) that monthly PCE inflation would rise a little, helped ensure an unduly aggressive buildup. The eventual numbers, bad but no worse than feared, therefore prompted a sharp fall in yields. By the end of the day, that too had been reversed. The market thinks it’s now got it right that the Fed probably won’t cut more than three times this year, which happens to be exactly what the Fed is saying. Still, someone must have made some money in the course of a turbulent day on the  bond market. This is what happened to the 10-year real yield over the course of Leap Day:\nJudging by the reaction of stocks, prices already reflect the more conservative outlook on rates from the Fed, and don’t think it matters much. The Nasdaq Composite rallied as much as 0.9% to set a new all-time high. That might signal worrying complacency, but there’s also a case for stock prices to be where they are. The key was to avoid another seriously negative surprise. “We've made it past the Fed’s favorite number without taking on any damage,” said the veteran growth investor Louis Navellier, who gave a straightforward justification for the ongoing bullish trend:Stocks continue to trend higher on solid earnings, low unemployment, and robust government spending. Fed rate cuts will eventually come and while they sit on the shelf for now, take some of the systemic risk out of the market by being available for rapid deployment in the event of a Black Swan event or a surprise economic slowdown.Put differently: Part of the reason fewer rate cuts seem likely now is that the economy and financial system don’t seem to need them. If things do deteriorate — through more geopolitical developments or perhaps a default in commercial real estate, then it’s comforting that the Fed has plenty of room to cut. For now, that’s enough to allow the stock market to keep trundling forward. — Assisted by Richard Abbey\n      "

        "content": "        Beg, borrow or steal a copy of the Global Investment Returns Yearbook US stock markets aren’t as over-concentrated as they appear — but glob\n      Today’s  Points\n\tBeg, borrow or steal a copy of the  Global Investment Returns Yearbook\tUS stock markets aren’t as over-concentrated as they appear — but global indexes like the MSCI EAFE are much less top-heavy\tRate cuts really do boost stocks in the long run\t Bitcoin is barreling toward a record amid far less excitement than its previous booms, and while much of the currency is untraded\tTIP: Songs to  wake you up. \n      Concentration:  So What?\nThe US stock market is abnormally concentrated. You’ll have read plenty about it in  Points of Return and many other  outlets, as the S&P 500 grows more top-heavy, by various measures, than has ever been seen before — thanks largely to the dominance of the so-called Magnificent Seven internet platform groups. The S&P’s 10 biggest companies on their own account for more than 32% of the index.But does this matter? Is it even that unusual? This is an ideal question for the  Global Investment Returns Yearbook, an authoritative study conducted for 25 years by professors Elroy Dimson of Cambridge University and Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School. The Dimson Marsh Staunton study, these days sponsored by UBS, covers investment returns back to the beginning of the 20th century (and earlier for the US and UK), for stocks, bonds and cash. It’s very useful and tends to appear on the desks and bookshelves of asset allocators the world over. So, here’s what they found out about concentration in this year’s edition, published this week.The key point is that the US is not that concentrated by global standards. Indeed, it’s unusually diverse. Of the major markets, only Japan has less concentration in its biggest companies:\nThat implies that those inclined to avoid the US because of the Magnificent Seven’s preponderance will need to exit everywhere else and pour into Japan. If we use each market’s most famous benchmark index, the US again looks less concentrated than most. The 10 biggest stocks in Italy’s FTSE-MIB index make up 72.8% of the index (the bank Unicredit SpA is the biggest at 11.04%), while buying France’s CAC 40 involves putting 11.67% of your money into luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE:\nBut it’s questionable whether you want to divide stocks by national domicile. MSCI’s international indexes are more widely used than most of the individual national benchmarks above. The top 10 account for only 23.1% of the MSCI Emerging Markets, and 15.3% of the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Africa and Far East, covering  non-US developed markets). In practice, many asset allocators view their decision as between the S&P and these two MSCI indexes. They might want to diversify because the world is getting seriously concentrated into the US. This is how global market cap has been divided in the 124 years covered by the database:\nSince the American market eclipsed the UK more than a century ago, the US has been the biggest on earth, save a couple of years at the peak of the  Japanese bubble in 1989 and 1990. It now accounts for 61% of global market cap, its highest since the 1960s, when China and Russia had no stock market. Stocks are indeed unusually concentrated globally — but avoiding this has also meant missing out on years of great US performance.Is concentration necessarily bad? No, but it does tend to imply an unbalanced economy. Generally, each country will be led by one or two industries, particularly in the emerging world. The US until recently was an exception. It’s dominated by technology now, but not nearly to the extent as by railroads when it was emerging 125 years ago:\nThat the US is growing more dependent on one sector isn’t terrifying, but it’s disquieting — particularly as the tech groups may now be hoovering up earnings that would previously have gone to stocks in other sectors. As for investors, there’s something wrong with concentrated benchmarks, which is that they’re that much harder to beat. Active large-cap managers have “a natural propensity to underweight the biggest stocks,” to quote Patrick Palfrey of UBS. By his count, large-cap managers are underweight all of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, except  Alphabet. In most cases, these decisions have hurt — but given the need of an active fund manager to produce a balanced and diversified portfolio, they had a problem either way:\nOne solution would be to ditch the widespread practice of benchmarking, in which active managers are publicly compared to a specific index. That would be helpful in any case, as this tends to encourage herding around the index. A second solution would be to look away from the US, but use broad international indexes rather than the national gauges that tend to be quoted most in the media. \n      Why Do Investors Want Rate Cuts So Much? \nWhen is the Fed going to  start cutting rates? I’m not the only one who has asked that question more times than I can count in the last year. The hubbub is only going to grow louder as the year continues. So it’s worth posing another question that the yearbook can help answer: Do rate cuts really matter for investors? It turns out they do.  The question of monetary policy is of course intricately  connected to inflation. The job of investors, writ large, is to beat inflation, so this plainly matters. And just as we might expect, the lowest inflation years are great for equities and particularly bonds, while the highest inflation goes with terrible performance, again especially for bonds. This chart is based on each year in all countries covered by the yearbook, over its history, so it should do a good job of isolating the effect that inflation has on returns:\nBut inflation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It tends to bring higher interest rates in its wake. Dimson, Marsh and Staunton used a simple measure that could be applied in real time. In the charts that follow, historic returns are divided into periods, starting the first time the Fed hikes after its previous move was downward, and the inverse. This captures some tightenings and easings that prove to be short-lived, but the point is to see the effect that the change of direction in rates (not expectations of it) have on returns. In isolation, lower rates should improve returns for both stocks and bonds — but as they often happen when things are going seriously wrong with the economy, it doesn’t necessarily follow that rate cuts will always boost stocks.However, in practice, it looks almost as if it does. For both stocks and bonds, returns during rate-cutting regimes are far better than during hiking campaigns. In the UK, remarkably, all of equities’ historic outperformance of cash comes when rates are falling; cash has historically come out slightly ahead during rising rates:\nIf we take risk into account and look at returns divided by volatility (a concept known as the  Sharpe Ratio), the importance of rate cuts grows more pronounced. For bonds, the Sharpe Ratio during rate hikes is negative: \nIt can still be difficult to work out which way the arrow of causation is pointing. Dimson, Marsh and Staunton admit that it’s unclear “to what extent the poorer returns during hiking cycles are due to the disease (inflation) and how much to the cure (rate hikes).” But history does confirm that there’s reason to obsess about when the rate cuts start. \n      Record in Sight\nBitcoin still has fans. It cruised past the  $60,000 mark in Wednesday trading, with the $69,000 all-time high price from 2021 now well within view. It’s made a 45% jump this year, underscoring the weight of momentum behind it.Why just now? The rally came on the back of the launch Jan. 11 of exchange-traded funds holding spot Bitcoin. Crypto enthusiasts now hope this run continues with an upcoming reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth, known as the  halving, the next crucial waymark and due at some point in April. Even before then, institutional interest is becoming more commonplace. The ETFs have pulled in more than $6 billion, with BlackRock Inc. pulling in $520 million into its Bitcoin ETF in just one session earlier this week:\nThe ETFs have also reignited interest in the wider cryptocurrency market, says Fairlead Strategies’ Katie Stockton:We’ve seen great participation from the altcoins in this rally as well. I’d say renewed interest for sure. I’ve even seen some Google search studies show that’s the case, at least on the retail side. And with any growing level of adoption, it becomes more institutionally viable. Frnt Financial’s Stephane Ouellette argues that leverage in the crypto ecosystem, as defined by margin financing rates and the spreads on derivatives, remains “extremely far from those seen in a ‘toppy’ market environment.” Web traffic suggests the typical person on the street has barely noticed the rally in the asset in spite of the focus on the ETFs  — which encourages the bulls: \nFed easing, when it happens, will likely prompt flows to risky assets like crypto. Miller Tabak + Co.’s Matt Maley adds that ever since last year’s regional banking crisis, investors believe that the “Fed put” is back in play. They’re willing to take on more risk than they’ve had since 2021.But there are some disturbing signs. Maley notes how the relationship between Bitcoin and Dogecoin, a token initially created as a joke that was once  described by Elon Musk as a “hustle” on Saturday Night Live, might raise concerns:Each time Dogecoin has spiked higher over the past two years, it has signaled that Bitcoin has gone too far on a short-term basis. This has been followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin each time. Therefore, the almost 40% two-day bounce we saw in Dogecoin at today's high makes me nervous.Put simply, when Dogecoin spikes higher suddenly, it’s a sign that traders think that the crypto rally has become so strong that they can make much riskier bets. That’s usually a sign of a short-term top:\nAnother strange sign is that crypto assets still aren’t changing hands much. Almost 70% of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved for a year, Ouellette says. So even if the price is nearly back to its high, it’s not at all clear that it’s being more widely adopted as a currency.— Richard Abbey\n      "

Change the supply of money, or change the rate of interest, and its effect would only show up in the big economic aggregates more than a year later. But since the unprecedented shock of the pandemic, it’s experiencing the longest lag in history.  Secretariat-like, the economy continues to gallop far ahead of the Fed. The dramatic rise in interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve has, to date, had little discernible impact on economic growth or employment. Working out just why this has happened now becomes critical both for the Fed and investors as they try to navigate a course through the post-Covid world. One explanation, from keepers of the flame of monetarism, is that the  supply of money remains far ahead of its long-standing trend. If we look at month-on-month changes in M2, a broad measure of money supply, what happened in the early months of 2020 stands out as an unequaled dose of adrenalin. It’s true that M2 has declined much of the time since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022, and that it’s the change at the margin that normally matters — but this was quite a shock:\nTim Congdon, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher and now head of the  Institute of International Monetary Research, points out that by an even broader measure called M3, December saw an increase of almost 0.6% (an annualized rate of 7.2%). In the six and three months to December, he says, the annualized rates of increase in M3 were 3.1% and 4.6% respectively — consistent with steady economic growth, and also very surprising in the context of rising interest rates. His suggestion is that the federal government is funding its deficit by borrowing from banks, which has the effect of increasing money in circulation. Whatever the reason, the effect is that M2 remains ahead of its steady trend of growth which had persisted for three decades leading into the pandemic, with the  Global Financial Crisis of 2008 barely even causing a blip:\nThat’s one way monetary policy is out of kilter with previous episodes. A second is suggested by old friend Jim Paulsen, a long-term economist and investment strategist who’s now publishing a Substack newsletter in retirement. He argues that this tightening cycle is unlike any before it because the hiking didn’t start until inflation was virtually at its peak. The long gap while rates stayed effectively at zero and inflation surged toward 9% is marked on the chart:\nThat goes a long way toward explaining why the lag is operating differently this time. Rates have risen (a depressing effect on the economy) at the same time as inflation has come down (which should stimulate the economy) and have canceled each other out, just the way as the effect of the preceding inflation that was cushioned by zero interest rates. Another issue is that the Fed’s long wait created far too generous a window of opportunity for companies to lock in low rates. That insulated them from the tightening that followed. The following chart, from the St. Louis Fed’s economic data, or FRED, service, shows that the interest expense that non-financial companies pay now is no higher than it was two decades ago:\nIt’s certainly possible to argue that this number remains dangerously high in absolute terms — but in terms of its effects on company behavior, tighter monetary policy has thus far  produced little inducement for firms to pull in their horns. Companies have also been helped by lower corporate taxes, and by the interest that they earn, which has had the effect of reducing net interest bills to very manageable levels. In the following chart, from Societe Generale’s chief quantitative strategist Andrew Lapthorne and drawn on the latest results published by companies in the broad S&P 1500 index, we see that companies’ net interest costs after tax are actually down. No wonder it’s taking time for monetary tightening to have an effect:\nA further point that Paulsen makes is that historically,  disinflation tends to administer a stimulus to the economy over the following 12 months, even though it often results from an economic slowing down. These charts show subsequent growth in the year after months when inflation was down on a year earlier, compared to performance after months when inflation was rising. Growth averages 3.8% after disinflation, and 2.6% after inflation. Productivity growth is 2.4% following disinflation and 1.8% following inflation. \nUsing the same simple system, Paulsen also found that  employment growth was 2% after disinflation (compared to 0.3%) while consumer confidence rose by 8% over the following year, compared to a 17% fall after inflation. Earnings per share for the S&P 500 grew at a 23.8% clip, compared to only 4% in times of inflation. The intuition is clear enough; people like falling inflation. It affects them much like a tax cut, and tends to make them behave in ways conducive to growth. To the extent that much of the recent inflation spike and its subsequent decline were driven by factors beyond the Fed’s control, such as clogged supply chains, then the attempt to throw sand in the economy’s wheels with higher rates has been counteracted by the boon of disinflation pouring in.Looking at productivity growth, Paulsen found a negative correlation with inflation — when prices are rising faster, it’s harder to improve productivity. Generally, the relationship is clearer during recessions than expansions, but the current expansion is a big exception:\nIt’s at least possible that inflation is stoking productivity. The scale of the monetary expansion during the pandemic, and then the weird sequencing since, has made this a tightening like no other, and has produced a lag longer than any other. This suggests that there need be little urgency for the Fed to start cutting. Meanwhile, the booming stock market raises the risk of overheating and makes cutting harder. And then there’s the housing market. Sharply rising mortgage rates put pressure on the central bank to alleviate the situation and prevent a housing bust. After the latest numbers, it’s not clear that’s necessary...\n      Safe as Houses\nThe market’s cheerful optimism that rates would be cut in the first half of the year has almost evaporated. That needn’t shock the Fed, which is bent on bringing down inflation to within its 2% target. Its latest projections, to be updated next month, suggest only  three rate cuts by the end of 2024. With the Fed remaining keen on clues of price easing in data releases ahead of its March 20 rate decision, cooling  housing prices could provide some needed respite.A measure of housing prices by the  Federal Housing Finance Agency showed a muted month-on-month 0.1% rise, below analysts’ estimates. Another related metric, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home-price index, climbed modestly by 0.19% in December below the 0.25% seen the prior month. The chart shows how both have moved since the eve of the pandemic:\nViewed on a log scale, the Case-Shiller measure of home prices in 10 cities, which has been calculated continuously since 1987, is evidently in rude health. The decline in house prices that started in 2022 was nothing like the implosion the market suffered in the run-up to the GFC, and it can be seen even more clearly now that the situation is stable:\nGiven that these data are pretty belated, only now having been updated to the end of December, it’s not surprising that they’re often viewed out of the corner of an eye. BMO Asset Management’s Earl Davis believes that focusing on wage inflation and services (ex-rent) is a better measure of how people spend their paychecks, which should be a priority for the Fed. But does it mean that Tuesday’s release is inconsequential? Not necessarily. Here’s why.First, the Fed’s tightening cycle culminated last October with the price of financing a house rising to levels not seen since the  early 2000s. The Bankrate.com’s US Home Mortgage 30-year fixed national average rate climbed above 8%, a development that caught the Federal Open Market Committee’s attention in its Oct. 31 to Nov. 1 meeting, and widely perceived to have tipped them into making a “pivot” toward lower rates.\n    Homes in Aldie, Virginia. Photographer: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg\nMortgage finance that expensive could well freeze the housing market, with owners unable to move and lose the decent fixed rates they had locked in, while new buyers faced prohibitive finance costs. But now the measure has retreated from last year’s peak, falling by more than a full percentage point in a matter of weeks even without the Fed taking any formal action. That was arguably the most tangible impact of the Fed’s change in tone. The FHFA and S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data just indicate this housing price disinflation process:\nSecond, as well as a boon for consumers, the fact that the costs associated with buying a house are declining means one less data point that could cause the Fed a headache, and one less source of pressure to cut rates.  House prices seem to be recovering nicely without the Fed having taken any action, a process that, according to Oxford Economics’s Michael Pearce, can be maintained as the year goes by:The labor market is set to remain solid, mortgage rates will decline again as Fed rate cuts draw closer, and the supply of existing homes for sale remains scarce. That said, stretched affordability will limit the gains in home prices.Capital Economics’s Thomas Ryan argues that a partial recovery of demand on the back of lower borrowing costs will drive up competition for homes. But at this point, consumers cannot be begrudged for embracing the fall in mortgage or housing prices as a win, no matter how little it may be. And for the Fed, scarred by its disastrous misreading of the housing market ahead of the 2008 crisis and very keen not to make the same mistake again, further rates cuts don’t at present look like a desperate necessity.— Richard Abbey\n      "

        "content": "        Russia has failed to force a European energy crisis, and that weakens their hand That makes the Ukraine conflict more dangerous than it appe\n      Today’s Points\n\tRussia has failed to force a European  energy crisis, and that weakens their hand\tThat makes the  Ukraine conflict more dangerous than it appears\tIt’s now up to judges to decide whether  social media should be regulated like a utility or a newspaper\tTIP: on Liz Truss podcasts\n      A Third Year in Ukraine\nIt’s been two long years of Russia’s relentless war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade his country’s resource-rich neighbor has had grave consequences. Kyiv has paid a terrible price with the massive loss of infrastructure, loss of troops, and events that have wreaked havoc to its once vibrant economy. But Russia hasn’t fared much better. The Kremlin's recent conquest of Ukraine’s city of Avdiivka is a largely Pyrrhic victory. Ukraine is a graveyard for Russian troops, with nearly a million more young Russians fleeing the country amidst fears of conscription. Yet, while the tragedy drags on, investors seem ever less concerned. The VIX index of equity volatility, often referred to as the Fear Index, spiked with the invasion, again when nuclear escalation seemed possible, and when natural gas prices surged. But calm has returned, and Ukraine is background noise at most:\nThis is because the war, despite its human cost, hasn’t inflicted the economic damage that had been feared. Putin has skirted around Western-imposed sanctions by looking for business partners in the East, where the Kremlin found lifelines in markets such as China and India. Russia’s relief was Europe’s pain. Before the war, Russian natural gas powered Europe. The threat to it created a panic over a potential chilly winter without heat. Following the invasion, the quest to find a reliable and cost-effective alternative to Moscow’s fuel commenced in an atmosphere of desperation. Just as Russia has avoided paying the dreadful economic cost that at one point seemed likely, so has Europe. The price of natural gas is back to pre-war levels. In that period, the bloc turned to liquid natural gas (LNG) and other alternatives, and boosted its transport and storage infrastructure, while the US emerged as the European Union’s largest supplier in 2023.\nWhile the delay in getting $60 billion in US aid to Ukraine through the House of Representatives has raised the question of how long the nation can continue to fight, Russia is also facing that dilemma. At least a third of the country’s spending goes toward its military, and lower natural gas prices — which it already sells at knockdown prices to China — will not help, Financial Insyghts’ Peter Atwater says.Atwater suggests a possible linkage between Alexey Navalny’s killing and Putin’s desperation to see natural gas prices go up. In the period preceding Navalny’s first poisoning in 2020, prices reached historic lows (weakening Putin) — and then gradually rose as the news of the nerve-poisoning incident broke. Atwater believes this is a familiar script:First, if history rhymes, it would not be at all surprising to see natural gas prices turn up around here. Moreover, as I have shared repeatedly over the past few weeks, the mood is especially grim on the long side. I would be braced for a sharp reversal in the not too distant future. Second, given the connection between natural gas prices, Ukraine and wheat, a low in that commodity (and corn) seems likely here, too. Certainly, any escalation in tensions does little to help the flow of goods through the Black Sea, which remains the focal point of the dispute due to its strategic location for grain exports. That container freight rates globally have been rising again is already worrisome:\nEven as fatigue looms over the ongoing war, an end to the fighting, whether temporary or permanent, may seem distant. But implications cannot be glossed over. Ending the war will come with “deep consequences,” says Gavekal Research’s Louis-Vincent Gave:Many of the effects — dedollarization, changes in the way we wage war, shifts in agricultural policies to refocus on self-sufficiency — will be slow-moving. In the near term, the end of the war will be good news for the two countries involved — typically, in any war, the biggest losers are the countries doing the fighting — and good news too for Europe and the Middle East. At the very least, it will remove the threat of an energy crisis for the former and a food crisis for the latter.On the other hand, an end to the war may be sooner than most people think. A Trump victory at the November polls is likely to fast-track an end to hostilities even if that leaves Ukraine worse off, Gave says. In that case, US aid would end, and the EU would probably find it impossible to fill the gap. As President Joe Biden tries to get the House to approve a Ukraine package, the anxiety in Kyiv will not only center on when it will get the funds. It will also be keeping tabs on who wins in November. Declining commodity prices and measures of volatility in stock and bond markets show that investors are now relatively calm about the situation in Ukraine — and indeed were only ever greatly worried for the first few months after the invasion. However, the position is not as stalemated, or as strong for Putin, as it might appear. With Russia surprisingly undamaged economically so far, but also proving unable to inflict the pain on Europe that had been expected, the situation is more dangerous than it appears.— Richard Abbey\n      Social Media’s Latest Moment of Truth\nThe world fell out of love with social media years ago. What was once a fantastic tool to put us back in touch with long-lost friends has now been saddled with much of the blame for the breakdown of trust and courtesy in society in the two decades since sites like Facebook and Twitter began to take off. Few deny that there’s a problem in the way that social media has come to be used. How to fix it is much more difficult, and any meaningful effort to curb online abuse or the spread of disinformation would also curb profits.Social media groups are for-profit mostly public companies that have taken on a far more powerful role in society than anyone envisioned. As they also have such strong barriers to entry thanks to potent network effects, they are de-facto monopolies, a status that usually entails much more government regulation. They are now in a hugely responsible position. But what right does the government have to tell them what they can or cannot publish?Stock markets are taking notice, even if the recent stellar performance of Meta Platforms Inc., which for some reason is allowed to own all of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, tends to obscure the poor share-price performance of many social media companies. The Solactive Social Media index, in which Meta is the largest component but with only a 13.4% weighting, has lagged the market over the last four years, and is far behind the semiconductor sector, the tech play of the moment:\nThis is happening in part because outside the US, opinion has swung hard toward regulation. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has introduced legislation designed to force social media groups to remove harmful content. It’s modeled on very   similar legislation in the UK, and the  European Union’s Digital Services Act, which makes social media groups liable for what they publish. Meanwhile, the  Cyberspace Administration of China has clamped down on what can be published on the country’s biggest sites, helping to sink Baidu Inc.’s shares. China’s dominant search engine was once known as the Chinese Google; not so much now:\nIn the US, home to the dominant social media groups,   the arbiters are in the Supreme Court, and regulations must be consistent with the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. At one level, there’s something absurd about such an important issue resting on nine unelected lawyers interpreting a few sentences written in 1789. At another level, there is a sense that the US rules, likely to provide a template for everyone else, might actually accord with the important principles that really matter. Back  in 2017, when Facebook first came into the crosshairs in the wake of the disinformation that marred the previous year’s election, what was then called Bloomberg View published   this strong attack on attempts to regulate the platform by Tyler Cowen. It was one of the vanishingly rare occasions when I thought he was wrong, and I published my own response for my old publication   here. At the time, pressure was from the left to force social media into tighter regulation and policing of the content it allowed. Now, after various conservative figures including Donald Trump were removed from major platforms after the Jan. 6 storming of Congress, the issue has been driven by the states of Florida and Texas, which adopted laws that would thwart social media groups from doing so again. The challenge to those laws, on the grounds that they violated the groups’ rights to free speech, was argued before the Supreme Court on Monday. Tyler’s argument was that Facebook and its ilk should be treated like telecommunication firms. Nobody sues the company because two criminals  planned a crime over the phone, and so nobody should sue a social media group over content one of its users posted. That argument doesn’t wash, in my opinion. Telecom companies should not be sued for the content that is sent through their pipes, but the likes of Meta plainly have a greater role in shaping and editing content.When the   Supreme Court finally addressed the issue, it centered exactly on whether these companies should be likened to telcos or editors. If the latter, then attempts to tell them who they can or cannot exclude fall foul of the First Amendment. Social media has already displaced  much of the traditional newspaper industry, while becoming a crucial distributor for its content, so it does have a role somewhat analogous to a newspaper — and putting prior restraints on what a newspaper can say is very difficult under the constitution.  The arguments are dense and occasionally descend into legalese, but they’re fascinating. The transcripts can be found here. It’s notable that the normal ideological divisions don’t apply, with liberal and conservative justices seeing “landmines” and sharing a concern that rules like those in Texas and Florida would impinge on free speech — while campaigners for antitrust, such as  Columbia University’s Tim Wu, are happy to endorse more regulation.We’ll hear what the justices decide in June. There is a wide range of possible outcomes that could have a sweeping effect on society. They could also impact who makes and loses money. It would be wise to pay attention.\n      "

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has been on quite a ride since the pandemic, but recently gained strength once more and appears to be consolidating at levels comfortably higher than pre-Covid. Meanwhile, the decline of emerging market currencies against the dollar continues unabated. JPMorgan’s popular measure of EM foreign exchange is again close to its all-time low.  \nHow exactly do we explain this, and is the dollar overpriced? It’s not far-fetched to attribute this in large part to the sheer strength of the US economy in the past two decades. The answers lie in the underlying macro factors, which have been consistently strong over a long time, driving up the dollar’s fair value, argues Barclays Bank’s Themos Fiotakis:Over the past 20 years, the US has had higher productivity growth, improvement in its terms of trade, and higher returns on capital. It has outperformed other major economies in those areas because the US has chosen a different business model. The country has opted for policies that have supported its domestic economy while others banked on globalization, Fiotakis argues. The latter model worked when globalization was all the rage, but it’s not doing so anymore. Despite appearances to a home audience,  America has been putting itself first for a while, and it’s worked to some extent.Since the 2008 crisis, and the brief commodities boom that followed, globalization has stalled and even reversed. Growth has been slowing. Europe, China, and many emerging markets are exposed to this, while the US has at least to an extent decoupled. Policies that worked included backing energy independence, which established the US as a net energy exporter, reducing risk of supply or price shocks. Washington’s policies have also worked in Big Tech’s favor, fostering giants that have been very dominant, and attracted overseas funds.Rate ExpectationsMore recently, the prevailing high interest rate has also been a source of strength to the dollar. By now, we all know that rates aren’t coming down  any time soon, with Bloomberg’s World Interest Rates Probability function, derived from fed funds futures prices, showing the odds for a rate cut by June have almost been eliminated.At present, the market is in harmony with the Fed to the greatest extent in  months, as traders and central bankers seem to be coalescing around a view that the fed funds rate will be about 75 basis points lower by year-end. The chart shows the median prediction for where the rate will be at that time, from the Fed’s summary of economic projections, updated every three months and known as the dot plot, against futures’ predictions. The cut in December’s dot plot unleashed heavy speculation that rates would fall far more; now the market has swung back into line. If the Federal Open Market Committee resists further revisions at next month’s meeting, rates might find some stability — at a level that supports the dollar: \nThe shift in expectations toward cutting rates later and by less than previously anticipated is boosting the outlook for the greenback, says Jefferies LLC’s Brad Bechtel, because it maintains the high extra yield that can be made in dollars compared to other major economies. DataRegardless, the only rate action the market sees is a cut, rather than a hike — that’s never been in doubt. Bannockburn Global Forex’s Marc Chandler sees softer economic data in the coming weeks helping cap US rates.At the same time, the technical condition of many of the G-10 currencies has improved and momentum indicators are turning higher. Growth impulses from are still faint in most other high-income countries, but the key, as seen in the fourth quarter of 2023, are the developments in the US. In other words, if the US really does start to show deteriorating growth, bringing back a recession as a serious possibility that will weaken the dollar. Many of course expect something along those lines. However, the next important data point is expected to move in the other direction. This week will see the publication of the Personal Consumption Expenditures data for January. This is generally regarded as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation and, as colleagues from Bloomberg Economics show, it’s expected to take an active step up:\nThis matters because until now, the PCE has offered a rosier picture of steady disinflation than other better-publicized measures, as summarized in this chart from Win Thin of Brown Brothers Harriman: \nIf this is broadly accurate, then the belief that inflation is already licked could take another step back. But the expectations bar has also been shifted so that a lower-than-expected PCE could revive rate cut hopes. Either way, this matters to the dollar at a time when inflation seems to be settling in at a slightly higher level in the US than the rest of the developed world. StocksSince the turn of the year, the dollar’s trajectory has almost followed the performance of US equities. To the extent that belief in US stocks is attracting money into the country, it should boost the dollar at the margin, while a possible developing bubble (to which we return below) would give further reason to be bullish on the currency. Nevertheless, doubts remain over whether the harmony between the two would spur the greenback, analysts at Capital Economics say:If, as we expect, the US equity outperformance resumes, this will probably provide some tailwind to the dollar at the margin. But while we forecast a bubble in US equities over the next couple of years, we don’t think that this will be a major tailwind for the greenback over the period as it was in the case in the dot-com bubble. In addition, a dollar rally could be in store if a trade war ensues. When nations try to make themselves more competitive by imposing tariffs, foreign exchange markets generally counteract by making their currency more expensive. That’s a prospect worth considering in light of this year’s presidential elections, notes Bloomberg’s columnist Simon Flint:The US-China trade war was great for the dollar. An additional kicker, should a Trump presidency spark a 10% tariff on all US trade, is that the shock to risky assets would likely be nastier. Such a trade conflict would involve goods equivalent to approximately four times the percentage of world GDP compared to the US-China spat. This would have a correspondingly larger impact on the global growth outlook and be a further boon to the greenback.Electoral uncertainty can often damage a currency. In this case, it could work the other way, with good polling numbers for   Donald Trump converting into a stronger dollar. Until such time as the political situation is resolved and the Fed starts cutting rates, both months away, the dollar looks set for more strength.—Richard Abbey\n      Bubbles and Buffett\nLast week,  Points of Return wrestled with the question of whether the US stock market, or at least large-cap tech stocks, were into a bubble. The  conclusion was that plenty of conditions for a bubble were in place, but the market is still far less over-extended than during the great Dot-Com Bubble of 1999 and 2000. Let’s stick with that scenario, and assume that there’s a significant risk of a crescendo of speculation, which would entail seriously strong equity returns over the next year or so, and some serious trouble thereafter. What should investors do about it?\n    Warren Buffett learned a lot on March 11, 1942. Photographer: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty\nWarren Buffett has published his annual letter to investors in his main company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. As ever, it’s a must-read, and not just for the moving tribute to his late right-hand man Charlie Munger. The Buffett approach is at first sight rather complicated. The man is the patron saint of “buy and hold,” taking stakes in good companies and letting them compound over the years. From the letter:I can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 — the date of my first stock purchase — that I have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, US-based equities. And so far, so good. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I “pulled the trigger.” I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that index hovers around 38,000. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been — and will be — rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakesOne glorious statistic he cites is that Berkshire’s share of American Express’s earnings in 2023 “considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase.” However, the fact remains that Berkshire currently holds cash “far in excess of what conventional wisdom deems necessary.” The sum: $167.6 billion. That’s a lot of money missing out on terrific American opportunities, but he doesn’t apologize:During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated cash from operations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared for one. Berkshire’s ability to withstand market seizures “may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity,” he admits. And it’s obvious the Oracle of Omaha thinks another bubble is perfectly possible: For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupant. When economic upsets occur “as they will,” Berkshire will try to be an asset to the country — and in the process use that cash pile to pick up lots of debt and equity dirt cheap. It’s not a strategy that will work for those of us with less than $167.6 billion in cash. But the Buffett approach appears to be to stick with stocks that look like really good resilient long-term earners, and plenty of cash to counter all risks. It’s worth trying on some small scale to do what he suggests.\n    Between mysteries in the Dordogne. Photographer: James D. Morgan/Getty\n      "

Once again, it appears that markets are partying like it’s 1999. Prince’s 1983 song was financially prophetic. In 2000, it would be “party over, oops, out of time!” Therefore, everyone should live life to the full the year before. That’s just what happened 16 years later. Current comparisons to the epic melt-up in dot-com stocks look reasonable.As the world contemplates the phenomenal growth of Nvidia Corp., whose market worth has just surged by more than $275 billion in response to its ongoing surge in profits, thoughts turn not only to dot-coms but the  Great Crash of 1929 and even the 49er Gold Rush.Such comparisons must be handled with care. The dot-com era was extreme. Markets can get badly overblown, and set themselves up for a crash, without ever going as bonkers as in 1999. Serious signs of speculation don’t guarantee a bubble will inflate that far before bursting. With that caution in mind, here’s the Points of Return check list of bubble questions:Is There Something to Be Excited About?Yes, there definitely is. History’s bubbles have been driven by innovations that are clearly consequential, but whose future and valuation are impossible to ascertain. Rather than miss out, people pile into genuinely exciting technology, and many lose their shirts even though it succeeds. That was true not only of the internet, but also canals, railroads and the motor car. Even if AI proves as big, it could happen again. Nvidia has unquestionably done something exciting. This is how its earnings per share have increased since it floated in 1999 (of all years):\nNvidia has sold much more stuff for a far bigger profit in the last 12 months. It also has a clearly defined idea that’s easy to grasp, in  artificial intelligence. This is nothing at all like the absurdity 25 years ago, when companies came to market before they’d even made any revenues, let alone profits. This time, there is a “there” there. The problem is that the presence of something this exciting adds to the risk that a bubble will form.\n    The excitement is justified. Photographer: I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg\nIs There Cheap Money Available?Charles Kindleberger in his classic tract  Manias, Panics and Crashes suggests that cheap money in some form is another necessary condition for a bubble. As we know, rates are their highest in decades. However, we’re in the very unusual position where the market is surging to all-time highs amid plenty of froth, and yet money is expected to get cheaper very soon. That’s why Citigroup’s strategists believe the AI bubble can go further:In 2000, it took aggressive Fed hikes to burst the bubble. This time around, the Fed may well cut into the formation of an equity bubble. This suggests to us to keep our overweights in the US, and remain overweight technology.That leads to a related question:Does Behavior Suggest Excessive Speculation?A bubble’s final stage is almost entirely about judging human behavior; buy an asset because it’s rising, and sell before it crashes. You can identify this in one way by looking at technical patterns, of how swiftly share prices are advancing. On that basis, we can say this is at best a very pale imitation of 1999. The following chart compares the Nasdaq 100’s performance over two periods — starting in October 1998 when the dot-com melt-up began, and from the start of the current upswing in December 2022 (apologies for the limitations of our graphical software). So far, this rally is far behind the dot-com schedule.\nThere’s relatively little evidence of excessive use of  leverage within financial markets, even if higher rates aren’t yet slowing down the US economy as had been expected. John Higgins of Capital Economics in London offers this chart showing that margin debt on the New York Stock Exchange has fallen significantly in recent weeks as the market surged:\nHiggins makes the following case:Unlike most bubbles, this one hasn’t been accompanied, at least so far, by obvious signs of high and rising leverage... Margin debt has actually been falling recently. And the ratio of margin debt to the size of the stock market has been doing likewise. People aren’t as yet behaving as they do in a bubble’s final speculative stage, which is good to know. The possibility of interest rate cuts does, however, suggest that fuel may be on the way.What About Valuations? Is the Market too Expensive?Yes, the US market is really bad value. (Plenty of others look much cheaper.) US tech stocks look almost as expensive relative to the rest of the world as in 2000. This chart is from Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research:\nAgain, we are not yet at extremes, and in any case valuation is terrible for timing. Keynes was right to say that a market can stay irrational longer than most people can stay solvent. But it’s important to note that stocks definitely look expensive relative to bonds. This chart, also from Higgins, shows a simple measure of the equity risk premium — the extra yield you get from stocks compared to bonds. It’s the lowest (meaning stocks are the most expensive) in two decades. It’s nowhere near as bonkers as in 1999-2000, when the premium somehow went negative:\nSo on this basis, it’s not a great time to buy US stocks, but things could easily get more stretched. The fed funds rate cuts that everyone expects would be a test. Will Denyer of Gavekal suggests that a continued rally “likely depends on one or both of the following: (i) earnings continue to exceed expectations; (ii) the Federal Reserve cuts rates and real bond yields fall—with no recession.” Either could happen, and neither is a given. Is  Concentration in the Market Excessive?Anyone who’s followed the excitement over the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, of which Nvidia is a member, will be aware that the market is very concentrated at present. There are different ways to measure this; none are encouraging. This is from Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid, and measures the weight of the top 10% of stocks in the S&P 500:\nThe only previous time US stocks were this top-heavy was in 1929. Once the figures are updated for this week, it’s quite possible we’ll be at a record. That’s uncomfortable. If we take a different definition and look at the weight of just the top 10 stocks within the S&P 500, the current situation sticks out even more. S&P Dow Jones Indices kindly provided me with numbers back to 1980, and I added the most recent figure after Thursday’s close:\nFor the first time in at least 43 years, and probably ever, more than a third of the S&P 500 is in just 10 stocks. It’s hard to draw any statistically valid conclusions, but notable that concentration tends to be greatest just before big market falls. So this, too, is disquieting. The tech sector is further ahead of the market than even at the top in 2000:\nDoes It Matter That Companies Are So Big?This is critical. Big companies got bid up to silly valuations in 1999, but smaller ones went ballistic. Nothing like that is afoot today in small caps. The issue, I think, is a genuinely new one. Companies just haven’t been this big ever before, relative to everyone else. I certainly can’t remember any one set of corporate results mattering as much to the entire financial world as Nvidia this week. But it makes sense because, as shown in this great chart from Reid, the Magnificent Seven stocks are now bigger than your average country. The companies between them make more money than any countries bar the US, China and Japan (which is only just ahead): \nThis is a big deal and leads to a crucial question:Does It Make Sense?Are the assumptions about what’s going to happen in the real world consistent with what we can truly expect? In the case of the mega caps, can they possibly stay this dominant? Joshi suggests not. Tech companies’ profits are growing far faster than everyone else’s. That implies, presumably, that their money is being made at the cost of others, which is perfectly legitimate if true but suggests problems for the  overall market. \nThe Magnificent Seven do compete against each other. And if their dominance expands, we can expect politicians to try to stop them in some way. Or, capitalism might do the job by prompting innovations that allow new firms and technologies to compete. Plenty of companies in the past had apparently impregnable positions and were ranked among the five largest in the US, only to fade. Examples include Sears Roebuck, General Electric Co., AT&T, Eastman Kodak Co., and Intel Corp. In the case of Intel, the decline is phenomenal. The world’s former dominant chipmaker is worth $300 billion less than in 2000. At one point, Intel’s market cap was  $497.6 billion bigger than Nvidia’s; now it’s $1.78 trillion behind. Dominance isn’t necessarily forever, but now that the Magnificents are deemed to have macro importance, a Kodak-like decline would hurt for the world at large.\n    Disrupted. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon\nThere’s also the issue of whether we can buy access to the growth from AI. In 2000, by and large, we couldn’t: Google wasn’t yet public, and Facebook didn’t exist. Amid gold rushes, Joshi points out, there’s an instinct to buy “picks and shovels” — the infrastructure enabling people to  mine for gold. That might help explain the huge rise in demand for Nvidia’s chips, as people perhaps over-arm themselves with AI picks and shovels. It also explains Cisco’s brief tenure as the world’s largest company in early 2000, and the fervor around mobile telephony in the 1990s. The problem is that even when a technology fulfills all the greatest hopes in it, as when everyone got a phone for their pocket, the companies that seem like a direct stake won’t necessarily profit. Reid’s chart compares the growth in mobile phones with the performance of telecommunications stocks:\nIf you bought in 2000, you were dead right about the future growth of mobile telephony. And you lost a hideous amount of money. So, Is This a Bubble?If 1999 is our benchmark, this definitely isn’t a bubble just yet. That could change if cheaper money is added to the classic pre-condition of an exciting new technology on which people don’t want to miss out. Those who wish to try the dangerous job of timing a bubble probably have a while to do so. Beyond judging how others will behave, though, piling in would imply confidence that the soft economic landing with lower rates scenario actually comes true, along with confidence that the biggest companies will carry on growing unimpeded. If that happens, there’s plenty more partying ahead. Just try not to think what would come after. \n      "

It puts a likely new milestone for the S&P 500 in the shade. The Nikkei suffers from some methodological flaws, and the Topix index, still a little short of a breakthrough, is more important these days. But it’s undeniably a big moment.Will buying the Nikkei now  work out better than the last time it reached this level? There’s plenty of hype about Japan, which in many cases seems to be attracting investors who would otherwise be putting money into China. (Read Bloomberg Opinion colleagues Gearoid Reidy and Shuli Ren.) And there’s a powerful long-term inverse relationship between the yen and the stock market, which basically proceeds on the assumption that Japan is totally dependent on exports, and so a cheaper yen will be good for equities. But there’s a deal more to it than that, and good reason to think Japanese stocks can continue to rally.First, corporate fundamentals are generating real optimism. So far this year, projections for 2024 and 2025 earnings per share have fallen across the world — with the sole exception of Japan. That’s revealed by this remarkable chart from Societe Generale SA:\nThere’s plenty of room for growth because, as SocGen goes shows, profits are still below their pre-pandemic level, while market cap as a proportion of GDP is falling. Again, this differentiates Japan sharply from other markets and suggests there’s value to be had:\nThen there’s the much-delayed “third arrow” of late premier Shinzo Abe’s so-called Abenomics plan, which went into action in 2013. After the first arrows for monetary and fiscal stimulus, the third was aimed at corporate governance. Prodding companies into taking shareholders seriously, it was hoped, would spark a resurgence. Such changes take time to have an effect, but judging by record corporate buybacks, the arrow has now landed. The following chart is from Bank of America:\nCompanies starting to share more cash with investors will generally be a catalyst for releasing value. The circumstantial evidence suggests that value has received some kind of powerful catalyst of late. Value stocks, bought because they look cheap compared to fundamentals, have enjoyed a great rally. Particularly since the beginning of 2023, when the surge for large-cap tech stocks got going, this is the exact opposite of what’s happening in the US: \nPassive investment is very much more influential in Japan than active managers — something that isn’t true in the UK or US. It’s possible that this is due to greater risk aversion, as posited by Fathom Consulting, which produced the next three charts. It would make sense if it had created more opportunities for value investors:\nAnother point in favor of value-hunters: Companies are in decent shape. Japan has had many more years of minimal interest rates than the US, but it seems to host far fewer “zombie” companies (whose profits don’t cover interest payments). This is true on either a loose or strict definition, Fathom shows, and creates a greater margin of safety for investors:\nA final critical point is the economy. It’s not partying like it’s 1989, but confidence in Corporate Japan is palpably as strong as at any time since then. The following chart from Longview Economics shows the “Tankan” survey of Japanese executives (a similar measure to PMIs) for services, manufacturing and all companies. In services, optimism seems historically strong and is recovering even for manufacturing:\nWhy are they so optimistic? It comes down to the labor market. Under Japan’s corporatist system, wages are thrashed out in the first part of the year in a process known as the shunto, which apparently can be translated as “spring fight.” Japanese wages tend to be flexible, with a bigger bonus element than is typical in the West, and so there are times when wage growth goes negative. It tends to lead inflation — and so if current forecasts are correct, this year’s shunto could be the most generous in more than three decades:\nThere’s still plenty that could go wrong. But the picture of Japan as a market that is in decent health and underpriced, with solid reasons to expect a catalyst (or — to use the phrase of the day — tipping point) is a reasonable one. It’s difficult to sound too optimistic about Japan in too loud a voice after a decade of disappointment. But yes, the bull case for stocks is good and doesn’t rest solely on the yen or the machinations of central banks. \n      Macro Story (1)\nThat the Federal Reserve would cut rates in 2024 after a successful monetary policy tightening that has beaten inflation wasn’t up for debate. As recently as Jan. 15, the Fed was expected to trim seven times by 2025. After that, the market started dialing back expectations as more data appeared. By the time the Federal Open Market Committee’s January policy meeting minutes were released Wednesday, expectations had lost further steam. Forget about seven cuts this year; the latest prediction, from the Bloomberg World Interest Rate Probabilities function, is more like four:\nOne of the key takeaways is that the  Fed is not in a hurry to cut rates. It’s as simple as that. That’s  not hard to understand, especially coming off one of the most aggressive hiking cycles. Of course, some think inflation has calmed down enough to warrant enough easing to stave off a possible recession. That’s a very fair position. But as we now know from the minutes, policymakers would rather err on the side of caution, and inflation data since the meeting would vindicate them. That’s not to say there’s no price to pay for cutting too late, as Oxford Economics’s Ryan Sweet notes:This seems odd as there is significant disinflation in the pipeline. If the central bank waits for clear signs that the labor market, or the broader economy, is deteriorating, it will be behind the curve. This could make a soft landing bumpy.\nFor the immediate future, a March cut has now been ruled out almost entirely; the odds of a first cut in May are only 30%. Another issue is the magnitude of expected rate cuts. BMO Asset Management’s Earl Davis thinks the market never quite deviated from the expectations they’ve held since December: “Our base case (70% chance) is for eases this year starting in late Q3 with 75 bps total eases by the end of the year. 20% chance of no eases this year and 10% chance of a hike.” After a big deviation that is very close to where the overall market now stands.Andrew Brenner of Natalliance Securities is more optimistic about an aggressive loosening:If a gun was put to my head right now, I would go with five, which is down from my six, which is still more than the market anticipates, but I do think we’re going to get two months of good numbers and I think that number’s going to go back up to six. We could lower rates to 4% and still be very much restrictive, but people aren’t looking at it that way.Precise timing doesn’t matter that much, provided the overall direction of travel is right.If there’s one lesson from the not-so-great outcome of Wednesday’s 20-year  bond auction — which in terms of the extra yield that was needed compared to pre-auction trading was the worst since 2020 — it’s this: The market is once again buying into the Fed’s narrative of keeping interest rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury still yields more than a year ago, on the eve of a brief banking crisis. And amazingly, stocks are still prospering, in large part thanks to...  —Richard Abbey\n      Macro Story (2)\nNvidia Corp., the world’s biggest maker of chips by market cap, seems to have   risen to the story. As made clear by the headlines on the terminal, captured below by my colleague Katie Greifeld, earnings for the most recent quarter had so much build-up that the future of the world seemed to be at stake:\nInvestors had nerves ahead of the results, and there was even a very brief fall after-hours immediately after the results came out. But it didn’t take long for the market to grasp that the company had beaten very optimistic projections for both revenues and profits, while posting very bullish guidance. They even went so far as to say that generative artificial intelligence had reached a Gladwell-esque  “tipping  point.” There was nothing not to like and the stock regained all the ground it had lost on Tuesday’s collywobbles:\nYou can read up on the Nvidia numbers in all the detail you could possibly want   here. What probably mattered most was the  optimism for the future. “Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,” CEO Jensen Huang said, and would “represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.” If true, this will have macro implications.So will the notion of a tipping point, which Malcolm Gladwell defined in his  bestseller as “the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point.” To go to the acknowledged ultimate authority on all things, I also asked ChatGPT:\nIf we really have reached that moment with generative AI, which could conceivably drive a step change in productivity, then that is seriously big news. Gladwell argued that tipping points were inherently unpredictable, and it was seldom clear what small change could cause a broader transformation in society. For now, it looks like markets are prepared to take Nvidia and ChatGPT’s word for it. \n      "

The numbers in the  latest report on universities’ investment performance may not be as bad as they appear at first, but they still leave managers scratching their heads. Somehow, the average Ivy League endowment fund gained only 2.1% in the year to July 2023, compared to 11% in a global 70/30 benchmark (70% stocks, 30% bonds) and an average of 9.8% for the smallest endowments with $50 million or less to invest. That’s enough to raise questions about a strategy that has revolutionized investing — the Yale Model.\nAfter taking over Yale University’s endowment fund,   the late David Swensen practically upended how such funds were managed, opting to go with long-term, real assets and minimizing exposure to equities. His idea was that endowments could use their ability to wait for the long term much more effectively in relatively inefficient markets. What followed was a hugely successful experiment that became the gold standard for asset allocation in the endowment world, and increasingly in other long-term institutions, not just the Ivies.In absolute terms, the average Ivy’s performance in fiscal 2023 was an improvement over the preceding year's, where they lost 2.4% compared to a 14% slump in the 70-30 global benchmark. But none did particularly well; the best-performing school among the elites (made up of the Ivies, MIT and Stanford), was Columbia, which returned only 4.7%.What explains this muted performance? Firstly, venture capital ran into the worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis, with the Cambridge Associates Venture Capital Index losing -10.2%. Meanwhile, the Cambridge private equity index gained 6.2%, marking only the third time since the indexes were established that PE and VC have moved in opposite directions. Both asset classes are popular with Yale Model endowments. Allocations to VC on the downside and PE and public equity on the upside contributed significantly to elite endowment performance dispersion in FY2023, according to Markov Processes analysis:\nSecondly, this was a year when simply investing in passive funds tracking major indexes of public equities (the strategy that Swensen advocated for anyone who didn’t have Yale’s resources) did really well. The smallest endowments have little practical choice but to follow that approach, which as the chart shows has hurt them in the long run. For 10-year returns, the relationship between performance and the size of the fund is virtually linear; the bigger the fund, the better it does. But over the last fiscal year, that relationship has been turned on its head, with the largest endowments doing particularly badly:\nIs the Yale Model broken? Far from that. Ten-year returns continue to be healthy, and if the asset allocations of these elite schools are anything to go by, there is no move away from the time-tested template. The National Association of College and University Business Officers, or NACUBO, shows an increase in allocations to alternative investments to about 55% by the biggest funds, while fixed income’s allocation remained at 19%. The role of risk in driving long-term performance is never in doubt. MPI analysis concludes, “Over 10-years, Ivy and elite endowments show a very clear relationship between returns and risk-taking; simply put, these endowments appear to be levered versions of a global 70/30 portfolio. All schools exceed the 10-year return of a global 70/30 (+6.8%), with the average Ivy returning 9.8%, but with significantly more risk.” How great is that risk? With a 12.6% standard deviation based on annual reported returns and an estimated 15.1% volatility based on MPI’s Transparency Lab models, the average Ivy is projected to be almost 50% more volatile than the global 70/30 (10.71% standard deviation). The top performers over the last 10 years, MIT (+11.5% return, 21% modeled volatility) and Brown (+11.3%, 19.8% estimated standard deviation), show nearly double the risk of the benchmark. This leads to the greatest complaint against the Yale Model — that private markets, only rarely marked to market, effectively conceal volatility. Laundered risk is still risk: Despite the masking of the volatility of private-market assets, a stated benefit of the Yale Model, elite endowments are significantly riskier than a balanced portfolio invested in 70% stocks.Fiscal 2023, a year when investments in a few large stocks beat all comers, is probaby an outlier. Endowments avoided outright losses, and Yale’s model continues to look far stronger on a risk-adjusted basis than its peers. A few more years like 2023 will be needed before key assumptions are shaken. —Richard Abbey\n      China Crisis\nFor years, the great hope for China has been that it will be goaded into a “shock and awe” stimulus that will rally the rest of the world. Some strategists have openly rooted for things to deteriorate so that everyone else can enjoy some Chinese money. But now that something very much like financial thunder has arrived in Shanghai, the world seems a tad underwhelmed. There’s reason. The big move, announced Monday, saw the People’s Bank of China slash the prime five-year fixed mortgage rate by 25 basis points, to just below 4%. Mortgage rates have  never been cut by so much before. A look at the situation for the housing market, vital in creating the wealth that prompts Chinese consumers to go out and buy things, shows why shock and awe were in order. Bloomberg Economics’ measure suggests house prices were mired in ever greater negativity:\nThis follows an aggressive move to reduce the reserve ratio that banks need to keep when making loans, another direct stimulus to lending. But the impact of these moves, taken together, hasn’t been that great. Stocks in Shanghai have risen 2% since the Lunar New Year break, but a rather more dramatic repricing might have been expected. The currency is a big part of the problem. Twenty years ago, China deliberately held its currency too cheap in a successful effort to flood the world with exports. Those days are long over. At this point, its problem is to avoid the yuan growing too weak. That makes it easier to sell stuff, but in the worsening trade environment it’s more important to maintain buying power. That colored the way authorities chose to administer their stimulus. The mortgage rate doesn’t directly affect bond yields and has minimal impact on foreign exchange, so it was cut sharply. But shorter-term rates, more relevant to foreign exchange traders, didn’t move. That is because Chinese bond yields are now well below yields available on the dollar. It wasn’t always this way, and this contributes to the weakening dollar. As Capital Economics of London demonstrates in this chart, the exchange rate tends to follow the yield gap, which has grown very wide as the Federal Reserve tightens rates in the US:\nThe problem for China is that it has  lost its place as the fulcrum of global macroeconomics. In the first two decades of this century, a move by China would require a response elsewhere, as happened with several one-off adjustments to the exchange rate, and with the epochal fiscal and monetary stimulus it unleashed amid the global crisis in late 2008. Now, it’s constrained by the Fed like everyone else. To quote Mansooor Mohi-uddin, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore:Once the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates in response to falling inflation, we expect from June, the PBOC will be able to ease monetary policy more aggressively as Fed rate cuts will reduce downward pressure on the CNY. But lower interest rates alone in China will be unlikely to revive confidence in the subdued economy. Instead, further fiscal stimulus and property measures will be needed.The PBOC’s move can be taken as an unequivocal signal that Chinese authorities are now all-in on supporting the housing market. But the way that move was made shows that it’s now far more beholden to the US than ever before — and that eats away at the case for buying Chinese assets. Even after this not-so-shocking, less-than-awe-inspiring move, China will need to do more to re-energize its economy and stock market. \n      An Nvidious Position\nAs Points of Return has  pointed out frequently of late, the results from the biggest US tech companies have virtually turned themselves into macro events. Of nobody is that more true than Nvidia Corp., widely perceived to be the chipmaker that will benefit most from waves of attempts to use artificial intelligence. Results are due after the market Wednesday. And it looks like someone is having a  fit of nerves. Nvidia dropped 4.4% on Tuesday, shedding $79 billion in market cap in the process, by far its biggest daily fall in market value terms. That is a ridiculous amount of money to disappear on the back of no news, particularly when lots of useful information about the stock is about to become available. Nvidia matters more than it once did, as it has contributed more than any other stock to the S&P 500’s rise over the last 12 months (it alone accounts for 15% of the rise). That said, in context, this isn’t much more than an adjustment, and certainly not yet even a correction. This is how Nvidia’s stock has moved over the last three years, compared to its 50-day moving average:\nWhat it does show, however, is that a lot is riding on some very rosy assumptions. The growth in Nvidia’s earnings per share in the 15 months since the debut of the  ChatGPT app has been phenomenal. The market is currently expecting growth to continue at a more subdued but still impressive rate. This is how Bloomberg’s earnings forecast function (EEO on the terminal) breaks down the company’s earnings per share since 2021, with actual numbers in brown and projections in shades of gray:\nGrowth to date justifies a lot of hype. But can we bank on it continuing? If we look at how expectations for earnings per share for the quarter we’re about to hear about, ending Jan. 31, and for the current quarter have evolved, it’s noticeable that they’re still rising. Each of the last three earnings announcements has transformed expectations for the company's future: \nNvidia led an awful day for the chips sector, although the market as a whole didn’t do too badly — the Nasdaq 100 was down only 0.79%. And Tuesday’s nerves create that much more chance of another big bounce if the company manages to trounce expectations once again. The nagging thought is of what might happen if they disappoint. There’s little point now in speculating. We’ll know soon enough. But the selloff was a useful reminder of just  how much Nvidia has contributed to the rally of the last year, and of just how high the hopes are for its future. \n      "

        "content": "        Navalny’s death shows extreme confidence from Russia’s leadership. It doesn’t change the situation enough to have a great effect on markets.\n      Today’s Points:\n\tNavalny’s death shows  extreme confidence from Russia’s leadership. \tIt doesn’t change the situation enough to have a great effect on markets.\tThe Ukraine war leaves markets unbothered because  sanctions failed to close Russia’s economy. \tDifficulties for   Western Europe intensify as a result. \tDenmark has the champion stock market — and not all because of Ozempic.\tTIP: Scooby-Doo isn’t the only Great Dane. \n      Death in Siberia\n Alexey Nalvany’s death last week ended any hopes that he would emerge from prison like a Russian Nelson Mandela to occupy the Kremlin. The news isn’t surprising, and Navalny never quite stood the chance of taking over from Putin, who has shown again that he leads a ruthless regime that’s not afraid to eliminate his opponents. The news has caused shock and revulsion across the world. But financial markets, already on a rally, don’t seem discombobulated.A Putin-less Russia is almost unimaginable as the country heads to the polls in about a month. Is there any chance of a  different outcome this time? No, and not just because the main opposition figure has just perished in custody. Putinism is clearly going strong, with all the necessary levels of control, and anyone who stands in its way would pay the ultimate price — already, there’s a  long list of names, and Navalny’s is unlikely to be the last.Beyond Putin’s use of repression, however, his strength is also at least in part because the country hasn’t paid anything like the economic price that at one time seemed likely for its aggression in Ukraine. After two years of wasting money and lives on a bloody stalemate, and sweeping attempts at  sanctions by the West, Russia’s economy isn’t looking so bad, while the cost being paid by Europe seems if anything to be higher.Judging by the purchasing manager indexes kept by S&P Global, Russia’s manufacturing and services sectors have been somewhat less scathed by the fallout from Ukraine than their counterparts in the eurozone:\nThe pattern of an extreme slump followed by a rebound also shows up in the ruble. On a real effective rate basis, taking into account inflation elsewhere, along with which countries Russia uses as trading partners, the ruble suffered an epic swoon in the wake of the invasion, then an overdone rebound, and it’s settling roughly where it started:\nNone of this means that there won’t ultimately be serious consequences from an unnecessary and expensive war. There are ample  historical precedents to show that the price will probably be paid eventually. But for the time being, a combination of the willingness of non-aligned countries to step up trade with Russia, and an unwillingness in the West to suffer the pain that would go with stringent sanctions, have left both the Russian and global economies in much better shape than seemed likely two years ago.  Looking back two years,   the US stock market enjoyed a big rally on the day after the invasion, and did so largely because the economic sanctions initially announced seemed quite toothless. Horrors in Ukraine haven’t stopped a global market rally that’s lasted more than a year, and similarly cold-blooded calculations might explain the market calm as   Putin appears to grow even stronger. Could some of that strength be illusory? At one level, the fact that Navalny has met this fate, in the run-up to the election, is a big display of strength by Putin’s government. Getting rid of a principal opponent in such circumstances, when all the world is watching, suggests a  sense of invulnerability. But Clocktower Group’s Marko Papic sees more domestic opposition to Putin:There’s going to be a lot of people who don’t like Putin, and he’s not going to be able to kill them all. I would say that the domestic political sphere is far more complicated than many think. And I would say that there are domestic political pressures on Putin. For example, we know from polling data that it is actually quite difficult for Putin to continue the war. We have empirical data that shows the Russians actually would prefer the war to end, and they don’t support any more mobilization of young men to fight and die in Ukraine.I would argue that the fact that Navalny had to die and the fact that   Yevgheny Prigozhin both rebelled and then had to be killed, both of those are signs of a very worried and concerned regime.\n    A vigil outside the Russian Embassy in Riga, Latvia. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg\nNavalny’s death aside, Putin may also have been helped by likely Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s remarks that he would encourage Russia to do  “whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies who fail to meet the goal of spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. Trump’s comments prompted widespread revulsion, but thrust to the fore an inevitable conversation about a future for European security that is less dependent on the US. Rajan Menon, director of the grand strategy program at Defense Priorities, argues that NATO “should be reconfigured to shift the primary responsibility for defending Europe to Europeans.” That will cost money, at a time when Europe is feeling fiscal strain.Meanwhile, Trump’s political strength is already changing the picture and arguably darkening Europe’s prospects. The  delay by the House of Representatives in approving the latest aid opens up the possibility that Trump is already calling the shots, Fordham Global Foresight’s Tina Fordham says:Is he more than a president in waiting? Is Trump a second president? And the House Republicans, at least the Speaker of the House, are too worried to call an up-and-down vote on US aid to Ukraine because if he did, it would pass. And this is something that really needs clarifying.Over the weekend, Ukrainian troops began pulling out of the town of  Avdiivka, ceding it to Russian forces. That underlines the  urgency of support for Ukraine’s continuing war effort. As Fordham puts it, “The longer there’s a delay in US military aid to Ukraine, the more the momentum goes to Russia, and that would be a risk for future European security.”\n    Wasteland in Avdiivka. Photographer: Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty\nStephen Stanley, economist at Banco Santander, reports rumors of a possible “off-ramp” in which Trump would support “converting the Ukraine aid from a grant to a no-interest loan with no set schedule for payback.” At this juncture, such a messy compromise would be very well received in international markets. But it seems to remain as true as it has for two years now that a powerful Putin doesn’t worry the markets, as long as he doesn’t provoke a real response. —Richard Abbey\n      Denmark: An Apology\nLast week,  we wrote about the surprising fact that Indonesia has, going by MSCI indexes, produced the third-best performance of any major stock market over the last 20 years. Only India and the US have done better. This produced some feedback. Using other indexes, Indonesia might actually have beaten the US — but it’s probably best to make comparisons, if possible, between indexes offered by the same company and using the same assumptions.And then there’s Denmark. Niels Kjaer of BLS Capital in Copenhagen responded with the following:  Reading your note on Indonesia the other day, just as a curiosity we could not help to notice that MSCI Denmark could very easily have been on the list of countries having performed better as well — having actually outperformed even the US / S&P 500 over the last two decades. Our numbers show around 1,100% return for the 20 years to Jan. 31, compared to around 460% for S&P 500 (both in US dollars). Even an index capped using UCITS regulations (max 10% individual weighting for a company) delivered +700 % during the period. This of course does not change your point much, but Danish equities have delivered quite attractive long-term returns.Note the quintessential Danish charm, and also the fact that this is right. Denmark’s stock market is quite something. You can quibble, perhaps, over whether it qualifies as a major market; its GDP of about $430 billion makes it less than a third the size of Indonesia (although with very much more wealth per Dane). But not with its performance. Using MSCI indexes, this is how it’s fared compared to Indonesia, India and the US over the last 20 years: \nNow we come to the issue of concentration. If you dislike the US because its stock indexes are  over-concentrated in a few big names, then you should utterly detest Denmark. Like several other smaller northern European countries, it has a tradition of fostering a few huge multinational groups, so its market will inevitably be somewhat top-heavy. But that concentration has become extreme. This chart shows the weight the biggest 10 companies represent in the S&P 500 and in the OMX Copenhagen:\nNow we can see where much of that outperformance comes from. Novo Nordisk A/S, the company behind revolutionary anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, accounts for more than 50% of Denmark’s stock market. Of course a company that comes up with an innovative product that excites investors around the world is going to  perform brilliantly. In a small market like Denmark, it’s soon going to be the whole index. And evidently, there is some bubble risk attached. As with artificial intelligence and the Magnificent Seven in the US, it’s well possible that Novo Nordisk’s future profits are being overestimated. This could easily go pop. The excitement around   Ozempic also explains how Denmark has surged through in the last year to overtake other stock markets. It’s not a great idea to extrapolate that performance far into the future.All that said, there’s more to Denmark than weight-loss pills. OMX produces a capped version of its benchmark index for the Copenhagen stock exchange to limit the influence of any single stock. At present, Novo’s weight in this index is 8%, which is only a little more than Microsoft Corp.’s weight in the S&P 500, and very much less than its 53% weight in the cap-weighted index. Looking back to the inception of the capped index in 2003, it’s clear that re-weighting historically made very little difference — until a few months ago when the Ozempic excitement started:  \nBeyond all this, bear in mind that some credit must redound to the country for creating the conditions to allow a company like Novo Nordisk to do its thing — much as many point out, reasonably, that the US free-market system might have a lot to do with the fact that all the globally dominant internet groups are American. But for now, if you want to dive into Copenhagen stocks you should probably do it through the capped index — or alternatively, you could buy a lot of Novo Nordisk.\n    Cafes by the Nyhavn canal in Copenhagen.

As passive has moved to a much more dominant position in equity markets, such arguments become more plausible. At the turn of the year, Morningstar, the most widely cited group tracking the fund management sector, reported that for the first time that a majority of US investment funds were managed passively.\nOn such a scale, the concept of passivity begins to grow tenuous. For an analogy, blue whales are by all accounts quite peaceful animals, but drop one into a swimming pool and it will make waves for everyone else. Criticisms of passive management have been around for decades. Last week, it reached a new crescendo as the hedge fund manager David  Einhorn, most famous for his successful short position in Lehman Brothers in 2008,  complained in a Bloomberg interview that passive  managers had broken the market. Everyone in the passive world relied on everyone else to do their homework for them and set a sensible price for stocks, he said. Such objections aren’t new, but the volume of feedback I received to  last week’s newsletter on this shows that the interest only increases; so I return to the subject again. Two Mathematical PolesTo recap my main argument: Passive management, by virtue of its lower charges, will over time perform better for its investors than the majority of actively managed funds. As time has gone by, the stock market has grown increasingly institutionalized. Federal Reserve figures show that the proportion held by individual households has fallen from more than 90% after the Second World War to barely 33% now. Thus it was possible 75 years ago for all professional money managers to beat the index, as there weren’t many of them. They were also in a market with an army of individual investors who had their own reasons for holding stocks and weren’t necessarily trying to beat a market benchmark. Now, the arithmetic is stacked firmly against active managers.That is one pole of the argument. At the other end is the fact that the market could not possibly be managed on a 100% passive basis. If this were to happen, it would cease to function and  price discovery — setting a sensible price for different securities so that capital flows where it  can be best used — would become impossible. As it is, index funds trust the valuations placed on companies by the market, which means sending more money toward companies that already have a lofty valuation. This contributes to the formation of bubbles within the market, such as the  growing power of the Magnificent Seven tech  stocks.This received pushback. “If the concentration of passive was having the ‘locked in amber’ result you claim,” wrote one reader, “then we should not see a *growth* in index concentration — we should see more static index weights (why would trades at market weights *increase* the weights of the largest names? Mathematically silly).”This is true as far as it goes, but ignores that for more than three decades now passive funds have received net inflows. Last year alone, Morningstar says passive US equity funds took in $244 billion, while active funds suffered outflows of $257 billion. That continued a well-established trend: \nEach new slug of money gets invested at the fresh market weight. If some managers are growing excited by Nvidia Corp. and pushing up its price, then passive funds will also be obliged to buy more of  it with their new inflows, thus inflating a bubble. I also prompted some confusion by warning that if there was a loss of confidence in index funds, these trends could go into reverse. To be clear, I didn’t mean that most active managers would beat the index, but rather that as money came out of passive funds, we might expect the distortions to go into reverse. With each new round of sales to meet redemptions, the biggest stocks would see the greatest selling. Active managers, seeing the redemptions coming, would presumably take evasive action by getting out of the mega caps ahead of time.In this environment, passive funds would have somewhat better returns after fees than the median active manager. But they are the vehicles of choice these days, and if people get scared and try to leave the market, the exiting money will disproportionately come from bigger stocks. The mass of passive money in mega caps could contribute to an almighty mess. Price Discovery?How, then, do we preserve price discovery? To be clear, the issue isn’t the overall value of the market, but of relative valuations within it. Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, argues that indexing doesn’t help price discovery, but that that doesn’t make it anti-capitalist: Firstly, indexers do nothing to advance price discovery; that role is served by active managers (basically any dollar that’s not indexed is active management). If active managers own 10% of the market, that’s still enough for price discovery to function. Secondly, it’s insufficient to say that indexing is bad; it’s crucial to offer a superior alternative, that can win for the patient long-term investor, net of fees and trading costs.Arnott’s answer is generally labeled  “Smart Beta,” or using passive technology to reduce costs but tying funds to indexes that are weighted by different factors. If your ETF allocates based on companies’ total revenues and profits, rather than their market cap, for example, you can use passive funds to correct anomalies. \n    How much activity is enough? Photographer: Carl Court/Getty\nBeyond that, though, at what point do we reach   “Peak Passive?” Arnott suggests that price discovery can work even at 90% passive, and the greatest proponents of indexing have also suggested this over the years. In such an environment, active managers would need to make much more active and concentrated bets as they set the prices for everyone else. Still, the majority would lag the index. The growing interest in so-called active share — looking for active funds to have stock selection widely different from the passive allocations — aims to help this along. Adrian Cattley of Capeview Capital LLP in London makes a more sophisticated point about how capitalism has ways to correct any failure of the price discovery system within the public equity markets. The equity market, he remind us, is not the economy:   Let’s take the assumption that the Magnificent Seven attract the capital and their P/E carries on rising and vampire-like sucks the rating out of the rest of the market, to the degree that they cannot raise equity on the public markets. So far so bad. But if their price falls to a very low level, I as a private non-index buyer, can step in. If they have no way of funding a new project but the returns on it are attractive, companies not on the equity market will fund it. This point is the key one. The desire to make money on investing capital is strong everywhere, not just on public equity markets. It is mainly people on the public equity markets who are complaining about this.If Cattley and his colleagues can place money into a British homebuilder and “make 25% return on equity because the public markets have done their thing, then I am delighted,” he says. “Capitalism is hard to kill.”If this sounds  a tad Darwinian, that’s because it is. The average equity fund investing only in public equities is not going to beat the market. It’s a dinosaur. But if active managers decide to take their skills to managing private assets, then they might do a lot better than the S&P 500. Indeed, big endowments and pension fund managers are allocating ever more money to private assets. The downside is that such managers charge much more for their services than index funds, or even conventional actively managed funds.  The sum effect of passive investing may yet prove to be to make it cheaper for most of us to get exposure to the returns on the overall market, while making it more expensive to sniff out the best returns. Thoughts?  \n      Bitcoin Is Back\nBitcoin’s invention a decade-plus ago by the mythical Satoshi Nakamoto continues to meet with skepticism and optimism, almost in equal measure. For now, the optimists are back in the ascendancy. The digital asset has surged nearly 25% this year, reaching $52,749 on Thursday, its highest since 2021 and triple the level a year ago.What gives? Note first that the remarkable start to 2024 comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic approval, and the subsequent launch, of Bitcoin spot funds. They don’t help the original goal to be an alternative to the traditional financial system, but success stories abound after more than 20 trading sessions. Bitcoin’s rally has sent its market capitalization  above $1 trillion for the first time in more than two years.Wagers in the options market indicate that traders are targeting prices beyond the record of almost $69,000 from 26 months ago. They may well be banking on the so-called Bitcoin halving, due in April, which is intended to curb supply. That should be a prop for prices, as previous halvings have been.\nIf anyone has paid a price, it is gold investors. Outflows from gold spot funds have climbed to about $2 billion, while the Bitcoin spot funds have gained nearly double that amount since the SEC’s approval. However, the regulatory demands are moving on. Already, a trade group has petitioned the SEC to tweak accounting guidance, making it more expensive for US banks to hold digital assets for their customers.The group, which includes the Bank Policy Institute, the  American Bankers Association, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and the  Financial Services Forum, wants a revision of the guidance that directs public companies, including banks, to count crypto in their custody as liabilities on their balance sheets. That makes it more expensive to hold crypto, as banks must set aside assets worth a similar amount to protect against losses. Among the revisions are the exclusion of certain assets under the broad umbrella of crypto and the exemption of regulated lenders from the balance sheet requirement.This is going to require another big lobbying effort, but the campaign for spot funds provides a template. As Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co. argues: “If Bitcoin continues to rally and becomes more mainstream, the pressure on the SEC will become even stronger. How can they restrict the banks more than others if Bitcoin becomes more mainstream?”This isn’t what Nakamoto had in mind, at all. But if regulators continue to feel obliged to allow crypto to be a part of the banking system as well as the securities markets, the chances are that Bitcoin’s renaissance can continue.—Richard Abbey\n    Back as prime minister: Harold Wilson never had it so good again.

This meteorological analogy has market ramifications, as a tiny tick up in services inflation in the US is causing something akin to a financial typhoon in Japan.OK, that may be overstating it a little, but it’s true that the Japanese yen has taken another dramatic dive following US inflation data earlier this week, which had the effect of boosting US rates and strengthening the dollar against more or less all comers. The yen is back to beyond 150 per dollar, for the third time in 15 months. Before that, it hadn’t reached that landmark in three decades. \nThere is recent history of authorities intervening to prop up the yen when it reaches such levels. Added to that is the fact that the next move in Japanese bond yields looks very likely to be upward. Over the last year, the BOJ has been steadily lifting the policy of yield curve control (YCC) that kept the 10-year yield at zero. The yield is now capped at 1.00%, a level it has not yet reached. Further lifting would mean higher yields, taking Japan in exactly the opposite direction of other central banks — and presumably helping the yen in the process:\nWhy, then, is there such a move to sell the yen? Even with the inflation surprise from the US, it seems dangerous to bet against a currency where rates seems certain to rise. One reason is that the BOJ still needs proof that it has finally reintroduced inflation. The nightmare would be to end YCC and then see prices return to a deflationary slump. The most recent inflation numbers, in this context, have been disappointing; they’ve gone down:\nJapan still lives in a looking-glass world where employers and unions can jointly announce that they want  wage rises in excess of inflation. The process of negotiating new-year contracts, known as the shunto, is underway. It’s widely regarded as the key to policymakers’ attempts to bust out of the deflationary trap. If it grows clear that workers haven’t secured raises ahead of inflation, the central bank could be forced to tighten only very gradually. But last year’s shunto saw the biggest rise in three decades.Chris Watling of Longview Economics in London, who offers the chart below, notes that there are still widespread expectations of further wage inflation this year. “That should, at some stage, bring about a normalization of BOJ policy, and a phase of yen strength,’’ he said. “Risks, as always, are multiple and include the potential for ongoing/resurgent US inflation (and further/ongoing pricing out of US rate cuts).” \nA further issue is that inflation running at these levels while rates remain on the floor has brought real rates down sharply (just as it has reduced real wages). The divergence with US real rates is a relatively new phenomenon, and has suddenly grown very wide. On the face of it, just as high real estate rates are taken in the US as a reason why the Fed must soon ease, the same logic in Japan seems to imply that the BOJ has to hike:\nBut the BOJ has another factor to worry about: the  wealth effect. In the US, there is an alleged “Fed put,” in which the central bank will strive to keep the equity market buoyant. That way, people keep having money to spend and the economy hums along. If the BOJ wanted to exercise a similar put option, it would involve keeping the yen weak. Japanese retail investors, known affectionately as “Mrs. Watanabe,” have profited handsomely from the weak yen, and their decision to place money abroad serves to weaken it further. As the chart shows, the returns for a straight  “carry trade” in the Mexican peso have been phenomenal.  Alternatively, the heavily manipulated 10-year Japanese bonds would have outright lost money for Mrs. Watanabe: \nA sharp reversal for the yen would mess all this up. It would create an incentive for Mrs. Watanabe to sell her foreign holdings quickly and bring them home, which would strengthen the yen and should make more funds available for domestic investment; but that might be counteracted by the negative wealth effect as she grew poorer. That makes it harder for the BOJ to hike. “Despite a likely BOJ rate hike in coming months and a clear dovish Fed pivot, why does USD/JPY refuse to go down?” asks George Saravelos, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. “From our perspective, the key reason is that the Japanese carry trade into foreign assets is alive and well.”This is potentially dangerous. When carry trades stop working, they tend to do so in a big way. Such trades feed on low  volatility regimes. A spike in the VIX  index could be  disastrous. For reference, look at the way the yen carry trade into the Brazilian real flourished during the Great Moderation from 2003 to 2007, and then collapsed when the VIX spiked during the financial crisis:\nIf the BOJ really holds off on hiking for the sake of Mrs. Watanabe, it will be playing a dangerous game. \n      Meanwhile in Europe…\nAfter Tuesday’s US CPI print almost certainly postponed the Fed’s first rate cut in almost four years, it now looks as though the  European Central Bank might start the process sooner. As Absolute Strategy’s Ben Blanchard notes, an ECB easing while the Fed stayed put would weaken the common currency. The eurozone’s central bank could begin its easing cycle as early as June. The Fed will likely follow suit soon afterward, offering the euro some respite.The question is whether the ECB can afford to let the euro slip further. As the market shifts its focus from when policy easing might start to the magnitude of the cuts that follow, strategists at Bank of America note:We still think there is too much priced in. What we last heard from ECB-speak is probably the beginning of an attempt to guide us toward a much slower cutting cycle than the market is contemplating, at least until the data forces them to accelerate. Those diverging views are likely to converge eventually, to probably halfway between what the ECB thinks today, and what the market prices.This matters because the common currency has been weak for a long time. Originally set with the aim that it would trade in rough parity with the dollar, Gavekal Research’s Nicolas Oudin notes that the euro has been in a long-term decline against it since 2009, and may have a lot further to go because it has also breached a rising trend that links major lows in (pre-introduction) 1985, 2000 and 2017.It’s always of course possible to take such trend lines too seriously; they’re marked on this chart from the terminal:\nEurope’s sovereign debt crisis of the early 2010s remains fresh in memory. Growth in the euro zone has been slow as the continent’s biggest driver, Germany, grapples with a possible recession and its relations with other countries. To quote Oudin of Gavekal:For years, the markets wanted to believe that Germany would always finance France’s deficits. But today... Germany’s industrial base is being destroyed before our eyes. Simply put, this means that Germany will no longer be able to finance France’s deficits. In turn, this means that French long rates will have to go up — by a lot. But if both short and long rates go up in a recession, and as a result the euro does not plummet, then France’s budget deficit will really explode.Wednesday’s data on the euro area’s GDP showed signs of improvement in industrial growth while output remained subdued. But with the deficit issue rising across the 20 nations using the currency, Oudin believes that the European Parliament elections in June could prove to be the euro’s “moment of truth.”— Richard Abbey\n    Prabowo wins it at last. Photograph: Bloomberg\n      Indonesia Update\nDefense Minister Prabowo Subianto, 72, looks set to be Indonesia’s next president following Wednesday’s polls, with yet-to-be-certified figures putting him ahead of his two competitors. It can be seen as a vote for the status quo. After twice losing to incumbent President Joko Widowo, he had “Jokowi’s” son on the ticket as his number-two this time. His past as a praetorian general under the 32-year dictatorship of Suharto, who was once his father-in-law, has raised doubts over whether Prabowo can preserve democratic gains in the strategic archipelago, which straddles the Indian and Pacific oceans, and maintain its pull as an investor favorite in Southeast Asia. However, Clocktower Group’s Marko Papic argues that Prabowo can maintain Indonesia’s promiscuous policy of playing off both the US and China: “Indonesia’s relationship with China has just been so lucrative and China’s been very accommodating.” The former general is justifiably known to be quick-tempered and unpredictable. But in contrast with Jokowi, he’s highly articulate and at ease in wide-ranging discussions with foreigners. He also has a strong geo-strategic sense that he’s going to need it in these  challenging times. \n    John Maynard Keynes psyching up for the Big Game.

And RIP the great British broadcaster Steve Wright.\n      These Numbers Were  Too Hot to Handle\nGoldilocks should be careful she doesn’t burn her lips. After a startling  US inflation report for January, it’s plain that her porridge isn’t too cold, at least not yet — but it very well might be too hot. That led to an interesting readjustment on markets, as traders pondered the possibility that Team Transitory hadn’t been right after all.The debate throughout 2021 was whether the inflation then taking hold was truly “transitory” — driven by temporary supply blockages caused by the pandemic — and would come down without the help of hawkishness from central banks. Team Transitory lost that battle, but they certainly had a point that much of that extreme spike was indeed short-lived. That shows up if we compare month-on-month rises in goods (excluding always erratic food and energy) and services. Goods suffered a huge shock that is now over; services inflation, however, has moved to a level notably higher than before the pandemic. Goods inflation fell last month, while services rose:\nTo illustrate how the price-shock pig worked its way through the python, the following screenshot from the Bloomberg terminal’s ECAN <GO> function shows the contribution over the last five years of food, energy, services and goods. Goods and energy drove it at first. Now, services (in yellow) is substantially all of the problem: \nIt’s the month-on-month figures that show the problem clearest. On a year-on-year basis, services inflation is coming down, though a little disappointingly slowly. Month-on-month, it’s back close to its peak: \nBreaking down the sector into shelter (whose measurement grows ever more controversial as it accounts for a bigger share of overall inflation), and the Federal Reserve’s so-called “supercore” measure of services excluding shelter, we find that the supercore is rising, while the disinflation of shelter (which should be in full swing now, to judge from real-time indexes of new leases being signed) is proceeding slowly:\nSupercore matters to the Fed because it is particularly sensitive to wages. The salary bill is a large part of a service company’s budget, much of it paid to relatively lowly paid workers. The concern as inflation took hold in 2021 was that the fast inflation of the goods that people needed to buy would prompt stronger wage demands. That would push services inflation upward, and risk embedding higher expectations. The January numbers suggest that that’s exactly what is now happening.There are arguments to be made against this. Shelter inflation is probably overstated, while the overall services number may be inflated by financial services, which is affected by the level of the stock market — when equities have had a rally, as now, that will tend to increase the fees charged in the financial sector.However, it would be dangerous to dismiss January as a quirk. More sophisticated statistical measures carried out by different research groups within the Fed confirm a picture of rising, not falling, inflationary pressure. The Cleveland Fed’s trimmed mean, which excludes the biggest outliers in either direction and takes the average of the rest, saw its biggest rise last month since early in 2023. The overall year-on-year measure is barely below 4%. So this can’t be attributed to some quirky outliers:\nThe Atlanta Fed keeps an index of sticky prices, for goods and services whose prices take a long time to change and tend not to go down. As a rule, it’s when this number develops momentum that central banks need to fear that inflation has become engrained again. And over the last three months, sticky price inflation has picked up. The decrease in the year-on-year measure has stalled:\nNone of these numbers suggests disaster, or anything like it. But they clearly suggest that it would be premature to declare victory. And they deepen the quandary for the Fed’s policymakers. On these figures, it would be foolish to cut. The Personal Consumption Expenditure number, separately calculated and not yet available for January, suggests price rises are lower, particularly in services, and implies that cuts might already be possible. Further hikes are hard to imagine unless the PCE shifts hard upward, but the risk of overheating or “no landing” (in which the economy carries on strong and eventually forces the Fed to tighten until it forces a recession) looks significant. “Is the Fed too tight?” asks Steven Blitz of TS Lombard. “Current data say no, future data are unclear. Hedging their bet, the Fed holds back on cutting and communicates easing. Inflation lurks.”The numbers produced a sharp change in fed funds forecasts as measured by Bloomberg’s World Interest Rate Probabilities function using fed funds futures. The chart below shows the projected path for fed funds at three points: Oct. 18, 2023, which we now know was when “higher for longer” sentiment peaked, Jan. 12 of this year, when belief that the Fed had made a decisive pivot toward cutting reached its own peak, and at Tuesday’s close of trade after the January CPI. The projected flight path now is much closer to the one that was predicted last October than to the model dominating traders’ hopes a month ago. It’s also moving closer to the Fed’s own current predictions published in its so-called “dot plot” of economic projections last December. \nMeanwhile, that view of the Fed is also expressed in the bond market, which saw a major selloff. The yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) has gone back above 2%, while the benchmark 10-year nominal rate is now firmly above 4% again. Both are very much higher than would have been predicted a year ago, and much closer to the top of their recent range than the bottom:\nAnd then there’s the matter of how this all played out in the stock market…\n      The Thundering Herd Was Bullish\nHandily, the latest monthly survey of global fund managers from Bank of America Corp. was published only hours before the CPI data changed some assumptions. Overall, bullishness was back, which is always a cautionary signal that the market is setting itself up for a fall:\nThis measure is smooshed together from BofA’s readings on how heavily managers are allocated to cash and to equities, and on their growth expectations. It shows a sharp improvement in the last year, which has been mirrored in the surge in stock markets, but it’s still a long way short of previous extremes. The bullishness ahead of the CPI number looked premature; it didn’t look crazy.With investors so bullish in advance, and with bond yields rising sharply, it’s no surprise that stocks had a  bad fall. For the time being, though, that drop doesn’t look excessive. Bottom-pickers were already trying to buy bargains by the end of Tuesday’s trading, and the day follows a protracted rally with no pullback of any significance since sentiment on rates suddenly shifted last October. As the lines I drew on this terminal chart show, the upward trend in force since then remains intact:\nBut it’s important that concerns about an inflation report like this were definitely present. Belief in a possible soft landing for the economy remained dominant, according to BofA, but a sizable minority (19%) rated “no landing” as their base case. That is up sharply from the turn of the year, and the new inflation data will tend to confirm and reinforce those who think that overheating is now the greatest concern. While traders weren’t positioned for what happened, they have been waking up to the risk of overheating: \nThe soft landing hopes did, however, contribute to heavy positioning in US equities. It’s startling how much sentiment toward the US has turned around since the brief regional banking crisis last spring:\nAs for distribution within stocks, the belief that the Magnificent Seven have become the most crowded trade on the planet has grown overwhelming, with 61% naming it. This hasn’t, in aggregate, stopped plenty of fund managers from piling into the stocks and worsening the problem:\nIndeed, they’re back to being as overweight in technology, compared to their benchmarks, as they have been in years:\nThe real consequences of the excitement over Big Tech were on full display. With the partial exception of Nvidia Corp., which remained unchanged, the Magnificent stocks all fell heavily. Most spectacularly (though it’s not one of the Seven), ARM Holdings Plc, the UK-based semiconductor manufacturer that recently listed in the US, endured  absurd turbulence in the backwash from an earnings announcement last week that was perceived as showing that it was well positioned to benefit from artificial intelligence. By Monday lunchtime, it was up more than 30% for the day; it tanked at the open on Tuesday, after the CPI numbers, and by close of trade was down for the week. Trading activity like this in a large company (its market cap at the close was $123 billion) is very unusual. There’s certainly some froth, and there’s definitely too much of a crowd in AI stocks:\nIn broader perspective, however, worries about “higher for longer” rates would tend to be worse for bond prices than for stocks. Thus stocks reached a new high relative to bonds (as proxied by the most popular exchange-traded funds for the two asset classes), even as the S&P had a bad day. This is a startlingly strong trend that has persisted almost uninterrupted since the worst days of the pandemic in 2020:\nFor the medium term, a no-landing possibly followed by more rate hikes would be awful for bonds, while equities would at least be helped by rising corporate revenues. And there’s plenty more data this week that could change the base case yet again, or confirm us in our fear of overheating. If the economy is really moving too fast for its own good, that would show up in retail sales (due Thursday) and producer prices (due Friday). While we wait, the current market positioning seems sensible. It would be unwise to make too big a bet against either a soft landing or an overheat. \n      "

Within hours of receiving this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish US consumer price index data for January. For some years now, this has been the most closely watched economic release on the planet, largely but not exclusively because of the influence it has on the Federal Reserve’s decision-making. How much does it matter now and are we looking at the right number?That the Fed will cut rates this year is almost a given. It’s the magnitude and timing of those cuts that remain uncertain. But we do know from Chair Jerome Powell's CBS 60 Minutes interview that a March cut is “unlikely.” The question will now be how the latest inflation numbers shift his calculation.Much depends on which data the Fed looks at most closely. Last year, Powell and colleagues put much emphasis on a measure that came to be dubbed the “Supercore,” covering only services inflation, excluding shelter. It is immune to the extreme supply bottlenecks that drove inflation higher in the first place, and is also less prone to distortions caused by lags in the way the government collects house-price data. The worrying news is that this measure has stalled at about 4%, and so the January number will attract much attention. However, the Fed officially targets personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, which isn’t available until the end of the month. The latest core PCE numbers suggest disinflation moving on swiftly enough to allow rate cuts soon: \nCue in more data. Firstly, Friday's annual CPI revisions somewhat reiterated core CPI’s disinflation path. They brought core-services inflation lower for the end of the year, owing to a downward adjustment in rent and medical services. As disinflation has been disappointing on that measure for the last six months, that at the margin increases the chances of earlier rate cuts. Even so, the market’s odds of a cut — 1 in 5 (down from pricing it as a virtual certainty at the beginning of the year) — show that dealers largely believe Powell.It’s still important, however, that the market isn’t entirely ruling out a March cut. Bloomberg US Chief Economist Anna Wong believes that there's still plenty of upcoming data that could “change the tune” of whether the Fed begins its easing at its next meeting or later:Our baseline is for the Fed to cut in May — some people think it's due — but we still think given the inflation data that March is still on the table.If expectations are broadly correct, then the January CPI will leave a rate cut open as a possibility, as analysts appear united in further declines. Whether looking at headline or core measures, all economists polled by Bloomberg are braced for a fall compared to December:\nIt’s possible that a surprisingly high inflation reading for January could take such a cut off the table. Further, while disinflation is what the Fed is looking out for, it matters most what component is driving it, analysts at Bank of America argue. Beyond the Supercore, they suggest that investors will anxiously look out for signs of shelter disinflation (which would come as a relief), along with reassurance that there is no pickup in goods inflation, which has come under control. They expect the divergence between goods and services to persist and even widen in January as “we forecast core goods prices fell by 0.3% month on month, but core services increased by 0.5%.”Bloomberg Economics expects US CPI at 3% year on year, down from 3.4% in December. On a month-on-month basis, there's an anticipation of a 0.2% increase, unchanged from the previous month. It is projected at 3.8% year on year, down from 3.9%, and 0.3% month on month, as in December. If these numbers are right, they would bolster the current consensus that there’ll be no rate cut in March, but that the Fed should start to ease in the summer.The 5.7 percentage points that inflation has shed since it peaked in June 2022 provides plenty of circumstantial evidence that the Fed's monetary policy has worked, but further disinflation is no guarantee. The Fed must still navigate risks both to the downside and the upside to bring inflation down to its 2% target.Bannockburn Global Forex's Marc Chandler says that this “last mile” is the “most difficult and sometimes the most expensive.” The risk of a resurgence in inflation has also not been banished, despite the progress of the past 18 months, and history shows that past inflationary episodes tended to move in waves, with a series of peaks a few years apart.  Earl Davis of BMO Asset Management suggests wage inflation remains the key concern, with odds of a rate cut coming down sharply in the wake of this month’s unemployment report, which showed real wages rising — meaning that people “have more dollars in their pocket to spend.” There’s also the risk, beyond the Fed’s control, that the situation in the Middle East makes it harder as the year goes on to route shipping through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. So far, attacks in the channel have driven up shipping rates significantly, but never on the scale that was seen in the wake of the pandemic, and when the Suez was blocked for a week by the Ever Given. It remains a risk to monitor:\nDespite all this, the consensus remains that the Fed will cut rates several times before the year is out. And there are still plenty who think that current market pricing understates the chances of significant easing this year. Until the incoming data can rule out the risk of overheating, however, it’s unlikely that bets on rate cuts can go much further than they have already. And now to find out what the Bureau of Labor Statistics has to tell us. — Richard Abbey\n      From S&P 5,000 to… Infinity and Beyond?\nThe S&P 500 topped 5,000 for the first time ever last week, and is still there a trading day later. Big round numbers like these shouldn’t matter — but of course they do. As Bloomberg Opinion colleague   Jonathan Levin points out, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average first hit 5,000 in late 1995, it was a cue for an extraordinary bull market. It took barely three years to double, and then surged from 10,000 to 11,000 in a month. To be clear, the Dow was far more widely cited in the media than the S&P, even now when the rise of indexing has made the latter index hugely important. Mathematically, each extra thousand-point increment involves a smaller percentage increase, and is therefore easier to achieve, but the succession of landmarks stoked excitement and gave many the impression that the market was doing even better than it really was:\nCould this happen again? If the market is right in its hopes for steady rate cuts even as the economy expands, it just might. The last five years of the 1990s offered one of the most stable rate environments on record. The Fed under Alan Greenspan hiked the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5% early in 1997, in the wake of his famous warning of “irrational exuberance” in  stocks. Even though markets grew ever more exuberant in the years that followed, the Fed didn’t raise rates above 5.5% until the first month of the new millennium. There were various reasons why rates stayed flat during one of the greatest economic expansions on record. Suffice it to say that this was unusual. If the economy is booming, you’d expect the Fed to be trying to keep it on the rails.This is where the crucial similarity between Dow 5,000 and S&P 5,000 comes in. If the current consensus is right, we have economic expansion and lower rates to look forward to, all starting from an all-time high:\nThis points to why the inflation figures matter so much. Beyond that, the earnings season for the fourth quarter has done nothing to dent optimism, and expectations have risen to start the year. However, it’s noticeable, using Bloomberg data, that projected earnings are barely any higher than they were two years ago, and that the greatest growth in expectations is for the year starting 12 months hence, not one immediately ahead of us:\nThen there is the issue of concentration, which also increased during the bull run of the 1990s. The degree to which the big technology groups collectively known as the Magnificent Seven have dominated earnings growth is startling to behold. Since the beginning of 2020, on the eve of the pandemic, the 493 biggest US stocks that aren’t among this rarefied cohort have collectively grown their earnings per share by about 25%. They’ve slipped a little over the last 12 months. The Magnificent Seven’s earnings, according to our own indexes, have tripled in the same time:\nComplaints about the dominance of the Magnificents must be balanced by the fact that they are also the most expensive (and they’re considerably more expensive than the biggest stocks were back in 1995 when the Dow reached 5,000). Remove the top 10 stocks from the equation, as Andrew Lapthorne of Societe Generale SA does in the following chart, and the rest of the stock market doesn’t look too expensive:\nIf S&P 5,000 is to get to S&P 10,000 as quickly as the Dow did, the implicit hope is that a broadening recovery will allow them to build profits, while there is room for the multiple on those profits to increase, particularly if interest rates are coming down. It’s not an absurd idea, and something not unlike it happened a quarter of a century ago. We know how that ended.Even if it’s hopeful, or even illogical, to expect another 1990’s-style bull market, one counter argument remains. The risk is that things get too good (and so rates have to rise) and that’s always an odd position to take. Max Kettner, cross-asset strategist at HSBC, explains the contradictions beautifully:Our tactical asset allocation view remains one of ‘Reverse Goldilocks’ hitting risk assets and typical safe havens such as DM sovereigns alike. Admittedly, this is a pretty confusing position to take. At the end of the day, we are tactically cautious because growth is too good, not because we’ve suddenly joined the doomsday camp.\n      "

        "content": "        Don't ignore Indonesia's election this week In the last 20 years, only US and Indian stocks have done better Balancing act between US and Ch\n      Today's Points:\n\tDon't ignore Indonesia's election this week\tIn the last 20 years, only US and Indian stocks have done better\tBalancing act between US and China has worked so far\tFiscal policy will be the key decision for the next president\tChina's stock slump needn't hit the rest of the world — unless its economy goes into recession\tTip: Let's be thankful for Seiji Ozawa\n      Decision Time in Indonesia\nOn Wednesday, Indonesians will vote to elect a successor for President Joko (Jokowi) Widodo. Current Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, who is running with the son of Jokowi as his vice-presidential nominee, is contesting the election against former Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo and former Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, who are both part of the current administration.The stakes are higher than many might realize. According to Marko Papic of Clocktower Group: “There are only three elections that matter this year: Taiwan, which is already behind us, Indonesia and the US.” That’s because the country has maintained a delicate but successful geopolitical and economic balancing act for several decades — in Papic’s pungent phrase, it’s followed a “promiscuous foreign policy,” maintaining cordial relations with both the US and China, a strategy markets will want it to continue.Thanks in part to that promiscuity, the new leader will inherit a sound fiscal position, Eurasia Group said in a note. But the new president will need to continue pro-business reforms that have made the archipelago a magnet for foreign direct investment, including projects diverted from China, while also dealing with the risks to commodity exports that would be posed by a Chinese economic slowdown.Unobtrusively, the country has been a boon for emerging-markets investors for a generation. As this chart shows, Indonesian stocks have performed over the last 20 years far better than many would think. Asked which stock markets were the best over that time, many would name the US and India in the top two. But few would realize that Indonesia is in third place, ahead of the likes of Taiwan and South Korea. Any change in leadership will inevitably raise questions among investors about whether it can continue:\nAfter the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, which had a severe effect on the country, Jakarta pursued reforms that slashed poverty by half to under 10%, before the pandemic struck and drove its global competitiveness. It’s also overcome being labeled one of the “Fragile Five” emerging economies by Morgan Stanley, or part of Deutsche Bank AG’s BIITS acronym (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa) in 2013 as rising rates turned investor sentiment against countries particularly reliant on foreign investment. Now, the archipelago is in the twilight of a 20-year development plan ending in 2025 that has on the whole been very successful:\nEast Asia’s fourth-largest economy after China, Japan and South Korea has grown steadily less dependent on the oil exports that contributed more than 60% of total domestic revenues during the surging oil prices of 1970s. The country built its manufacturing industry until the crisis hit in 1997, initially triggered by real estate problems in Thailand. Contagion from Bangkok uncovered weakness in the Indonesian banking sector with high non-performing loans and short-term debt. Bank Indonesia’s response exacerbated the bad-debt problem, while closing 16 banks. The result was apocalyptic, but lenders are now the biggest sector in the Jakarta stock exchange. Since 2005, the country has managed stronger growth than several peers in the region:\nThe fruits of that crisis response are still visible in the stock market performance. In the first few years after the implosion of the Asian Financial Crisis, MSCI’s Indonesia index moved almost exactly in line with its overall emerging-markets benchmark — but the difference since 2004 has been stark as policies introduced to strengthen institutions, cut red tape, and ensure transparency came into effect:\nCan this continue? As the chart shows, Indonesia far outpaced the rest of the developing markets in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, but has been moving sideways for much of the last five years. The middle-income trap lurks for countries that have reached this stage. The new administration will also have to work out — like others — how to stage a steady retreat from the emergency policies. Kunal Kumar Kundu of Societe Generale puts the arguments as follows:What is certain is that not much support can be expected from a public expenditure (especially public capex) point of view, as the government aims to have a surplus in the primary balance (thereby removing a growth driver), clearly intent on reining in its budget deficit following a few years of pandemic-induced spending to revive the economy. Perhaps the critical decision for the next president will be whether to maintain the cap on the fiscal deficit at 3%. The ceiling has not always been adhered to, notably when Covid struck, and the results were not so bad, as Udith Sikand and Tom Miller of Gavekal Research note:Surprisingly, that experiment did not spark a mass exodus of foreign capital: Foreign ownership of public debt has fallen sharply in recent years to around 15%, without any significant repercussions on bond yields. The payoff can be seen from the fact that Indonesia’s economic growth rate has held steady at around 5%. Similarly, inflation has stayed within the target band through most of the Jokowi years.Ultimately, Jesse Kuri of BCA Research suggests that Indonesia’s circumstances will ensure that it continues to maintain a balance between China and the US. That dampens the chances of spectacular growth, but also suggests that investors needn’t worry too much about any lapse into authoritarianism or populism:Indonesia is constrained by its vastness, institutions that limit the power of central government, the ongoing leadership transition between the remnants of the old regime and the younger generation, and entrenched business interests. These challenges ensure that another dictatorship will not rise in the archipelago, but also ensures that political capital to pursue market friendly reforms is scarce.There’s still plenty of ambition. The country celebrates 100 years of independence from Dutch rule 21 years from now. The new 20-year development plan dubbed 2045 Golden Indonesia Vision aims to make it one of the biggest five economies by the centenary celebrations (an ambitious target as it currently stands 16th,  according to the World Bank). Whoever is handed the task by more than 204 million eligible voters has a challenge ahead of him. \n      Good Riddance to the Rabbit\nIn China, the Year of the Rabbit is over and investors will be glad to see the back of it. An awful run for Chinese equities ended with a bounce, which was inspired mainly by the decision to fire the country’s chief securities regulator — not usually the kind of move that will build economic growth for the future. But as the rabbit limps out of view, a stranger phenomenon is the way that China’s difficulties have had virtually no impact on the rest of the world. In the US, the S&P 500 closed for the weekend above 5,000 for the first time. It set that record even as smaller companies languished close to 20% below their highs, and despite the implosion of Chinese stocks. This is a big change.\nArjun Jayaraman, portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management, argues that international markets are acknowledging that China has now become an isolated or idiosyncratic problem. It is affected by its own specific issues like real estate and regulation, and these show no signs of hindering US growth. The country is also on the wrong side of the dominant trade of the moment. “What has worked in the last year and a half has been growth,” says Jayaraman. “That’s a secular tech phenomenon that has powered markets ahead. China is not at the forefront of that secular theme.” If anything, it is more a consumer of advanced microprocessors. Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management, argues that China’s heyday while it was modernizing and buying raw materials from around the globe is over:After the great financial crisis, we had the great financial repression where interest rates were kept very, very low across the developed markets. And so developed markets didn’t really grow very much. As a result, Chinese growth was really important. But now what you’re seeing is somewhat rapid growth in the US and in other developed markets. So it’s not the only game in town for growth the way it was say 15, 20 years ago.If anything, China has helped the rest of the world’s battle against inflation, which in turn has allowed for renewed optimism that interest rates can come down. Industrial metals, long driven by Chinese marginal demand, have been moving sideways for three years, helping limit producer-price inflation:\nJason Hsu, chief investment officer at Rayliant Global Advisors, argues that a serious decline in Chinese economic growth would spill over across the world, but that at this point the issue appears to be restricted to financial markets. “If it’s just sentiment,” he said, “people are just pessimistic, they are unwilling to invest, they are just risk off, they are just selling, well that part is just more contained.” As sentiment can change on a dime, particularly in the domestic Chinese market that still tends to be driven by retail investors rather than institutions, he suggests that China’s stock problems needn’t worry the rest of the world. Another point is that de-dollarization — the supposed gradual decline of the dollar as the main international currency — has not advanced much, despite a welter of speculation. As China doesn’t have a reserve currency, and few companies have liabilities denominated in yuan, there is less demand for yuan and therefore, to quote Jim Caron, chief investment officer of portfolio solutions group at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, “less of a channel for contagion.” That contagion would come through the economy rather than through securities markets. If China continues to ward off a major economic recession, the rest of the world can enjoy the Year of the Dragon. — Reporting (one last time) by Isabelle Lee \n      "

        "content": "        Passive investing is under fire again. There’s a strong case indexing is distorting markets. And that’s fueling the rise of the Magnificent \n      Today’s Points:\n\tPassive investing is under fire again.\tThere’s a strong case indexing is distorting markets.\tAnd that’s fueling the rise of the Magnificent Seven, feeding a bubble.\tBut betting on the return of active managers generally ends in disappointment.\tTIP: OMD and Jamal Khashoggi\n      Marxism and Passive Investing: A  Jaded View\nPassive investing is back in the crosshairs. “I view the markets as fundamentally broken,” David Einhorn, the master value investor who runs Greenlight Capital, said on Barry Ritholtz’s Masters in Business podcast. “Passive investors have no opinion about value. They’re going to assume everybody else has done the work.” Meanwhile, Charles Gave of Gavekal Research avers in as many words that “indexation will destroy capitalism.”This thinking isn’t new. Back in 2016, Alliance Bernstein’s Inigo Fraser Jenkins defined the issue for a generation with a lengthy paper arguing that “passive investing is worse for society than Marxism.” But it’s been given fresh impetus by the continuing levels of concentration in markets, which has grown extreme. The problem with passive funds is that as long as they’re taking in new money, they’ll accept the prices then available in the market. Thus, the more a company is valued, the more the fund will buy of that company, tending to push the price up further. With tech performing well anyway, the argument  is that the weight of money coming into passive funds each month will add to the sector’s momentum, bringing it further and further away from the rest. Effectively, the idea is that passive funds become “bubble-blowers.”Exhibit A to suggest that this is happening: the amazing performance of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks: \nGenerally over history, it’s been a bad idea to buy the biggest stocks by market cap. Almost by definition, all the good news is in their price, and  there is nowhere to go but down. This chart from the Boston-based fund manager GMO illustrates this beautifully, with a policy of buying the biggest stocks at any point almost inevitably delivering a sub-market returns over the following 12  months:\nThe way the Magnificent Seven are  forging ever further ahead therefore looks alarming. Perhaps more concerning still, the tech sector (which only has three of the Seven: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.) has reverted to take an even more extreme share of the overall index than it did in early 2000 as the internet bubble was about to burst. The following chart takes the ratio of the S&P 500 excluding technology relative to the S&P 500 tech sector, going back to the beginning of 2000:\nIf index funds are momentum-inducers, propelling the stocks with the wind behind them to even more impressive feats, this is exactly what we would expect to see. Equal-weighted indexes, which neutralize the effects of large market cap, offer another way to analyze this. It shows the performance of the S&P 500’s equal-weighted version, in which each stock accounts for 0.2% of the index, effectively capturing the “average  stock” against the cap-weighted version. Most of the time, the  equal-weight does better, because it isn’t so heavily skewed to companies whose good news has already been priced in. Periods when the equal-weight markedly underperforms are rare. They tend to come during periods of serious stress (such as the Global Financial Crisis or the Covid pandemic, or to a lesser extent the bear market surrounding the Gulf War of 1990-91), or during a bubble (as happened with the dot-coms in 2000). There’s certainly no stress to match those most scary incidents at present, and the overall market is rising — so that makes it look uncomfortably as though this is a bubble:\nStepping back, these valuations cannot make sense. Gave points out that the US stock market is now about 70% of world market capitalization, even though its economy is only 17.8% of global gross domestic product. Therefore, he says, the markets are implying that “over the next 20 years, less than 20% of the world economy will earn three times more profits than the remaining 70% or so,” or put differently, that US tech firms will be “entrenched global monopolies stretching into perpetuity.”We all know that the  Magnificents are strong and profitable companies with a well-embedded competitive position. But it’s still hard to chalk their dominance up to the fundamentals. As the redoubtable Albert Edwards of Societe Generale shows in this chart, the tech sector’s earnings per share are indeed rising, but much more slowly than their forward-earning forecasts. This isn’t usual, and might be explained by over-enthusiastic projections of the impact artificial intelligence will have on the profits of the Magnificents (including the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which are not classified as technology groups). Fund managers doing a good job of price discovery might be expected to exploit this, and bet against tech shares, but they aren’t doing so — possibly because the passive juggernaut thwarts them: \nAll of this explains why critiques of indexing are back at the top of the agenda. It’s not clear, however, that the debate has moved forward much. Discussion has been frozen for decades between two poles, both mathematically undeniable. First, as passive investing is cheaper, it’s inevitable that passive funds will produce better returns net of fees than most active funds. This gap will widen the more years it’s compounded in. Second, if everyone invested passively (as this first point would suggest that they should), then there would be no more price discovery and capitalism would cease to function. Both these points are unarguable. Index funds are great value, and most people should use them as the bedrock of their portfolio; but if everyone were to do this, markets would cease to function. Neither of these facts, however, is any longer helpful. We know these things. The point now is to work out at what point so-called  “Peak Passive” has been reached, and markets become too distorted.That gives us another point of reference that has dogged the debate between active and passive. Logically, there comes a time when the mispricings become absurd, and those with the courage to bet against passive will make a mint. Active managers have predicted this moment (and I’ve encouraged them in that belief) more times than I can count over the last few decades. And like  Godot, the  moment never arrives. What reason is there to believe that this time is different?Perhaps the best is that while passive marches on, it’s true that when concentration gets this extreme, it tends to give way to a few years when active managers, particularly those based on value, make out like bandits. In the charts on equal-weight indexes and tech stocks above, there was a fantastic opportunity to invest in everyone else once the concentration reached a peak. The years following 2000 were banner ones for  value managers, and in many ways established the power of the hedge fund sector.  This was an era when good stock-picking was rewarded, and when there were lots of stocks out there that were undervalued and ready to outperform the market.Richard Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Associates (unconnected to Alliance Bernstein) points to a series of long-running trends that seemed unstoppable at the time, but reversed completely. Imbalances like this seldom  last:\nViewing the latest ramp-up in context, he suggests that the US outperformance of the rest of the developed world looks unsustainable. On previous occasions when it’s gone this far, it has been aided by over-concentration and a bubble in a relatively small group of stocks: the “Nifty 50” in the late 1960s, and the tech stocks in the 1990s. This latest round of outperformance has gone much further, but that might be thanks to passive investors. There were no index funds in the 1960s, and the concept was far less powerful in the 1990s than it is now:\nBernstein argues that the current juncture could be “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebalance portfolios” and sees bigger opportunities in international, small cap and value stocks and the beneficiaries of inflation:Just as in the wake of the Internet bubble, what part of the market you own could mean the difference between another lost decade of returns for crowded and expensive assets or very attractive returns on assets where capital is truly scarce.Optimism like this also permeates a survey of fund allocators carried out recently by the fund management group Natixis. “With rates looking to remain higher for longer, 68% of fund selectors say markets now favor active managers,” it said. “Should recession fears be realized, not only do 61% of fund selectors think it will show the inadequacies of passive, but 53% also think investors who rely solely on passive are likely to learn some hard lessons.”  The judgment of Ben Inker of GMO is similar, suggesting that good active managers are poised to benefit from a Magnificent eclipse:If the U.S. equity market becomes less concentrated – our bet for the next decade – skilled active managers are poised to have a decade for the books. Allocators who stick to basics, reminding themselves of the virtues of diversification, stand to benefit handsomely.Another way to put this is that they’d better start to find some stocks that beat the market, because otherwise the distortions caused by passive will grow all the more serious. And they’ll also have to vanquish one of the lessons of mathematics. Even if a lot of active managers do beat the index, those indexes are going to hold a lot of the stocks that they own. As nearly all of the market is held by institutions, mathematical logic will persist; after fees, index funds will do better than most. This is an opportunity for some bold fund managers to compound in returns far in excess of the market, but the logic that draws everyone into basing their portfolio around index funds is not going to go away.I’m sorry to sound jaded, but I’ve written up sunny hopes for active outperformance often enough in the past. There’s a good argument for betting against a bubble (provided you have the time to wait for it to burst), and there’s always an argument for finding stocks that appear too cheap compared to their fundamentals (again, providing you can afford to be patient). But the logic that underpins index funds is strong. A big recovery for active funds will require the chaos of a burst bubble. And if the public really loses trust in index funds and starts taking out money, after decades of net inflows, they could speed the collapse just as they sped the ascent.  \n      "

A\n      Today’s Points:\n\tTrump 2.0 must be taken very seriously indeed.\tA strong Trump candidacy probably contributes to a strong stock market before the election.\tAttempts to pick “red” and “blue” stocks and sectors would be very unwise.\tDe-globalization, tariffs and a weaker dollar are likely after a Trump victory.\tThe critical post-election question: Would Trump go through with attacks on main economic institutions?\tTIP: A final dose  of love songs; nothing beats the Beatles’ “Here, There and Everywhere.”\n      Trump 2.0\nYes, it could definitely happen. Everyone grasps that now. Donald Trump’s current dominance of the Republican nomination process, and his increasingly strong showing in polls for the November election, weren’t foreordained. Indeed, at the beginning of last year, he appeared to be almost out of it. Now, his chances are seen as close to 50/50, and clearly positioned better than anyone else. In testimony to how weak Biden is perceived to be, the candidate that bettors rank third, Michelle Obama, has an 8.5% chance:\nSo Trump is back, and a second Trump term is probably the base case at this point. And, as the man himself would  doubtless point out, the S&P 500 is at a new record and has almost taken out the 5,000 level. How will the prospect of Trump 2.0 affect markets over the nine months that still have to be endured between now and the election, and what exactly would he change that would make a difference?\n      Stock-Picking\nDespite initial appearances to the contrary, attempts to pick stocks that will benefit from a Republican or Democratic president have worked out terribly in the last eight years of extreme polarization and division. Christopher Harvey of Wells Fargo expects analysts to introduce or update their “red” and “blue” baskets of favored stocks in the coming weeks to help clients position for one party of the other. “Heck,” he admits, “even we got swept up in the blue/red stock frenzy back in 2020.”But since election day in November 2020, the S&P 500 is up 53%, while the Nasdaq Green Energy index (which might be positively correlated  with the Democrats) has fallen by 27%, and the S&P large-cap Oil & Gas index is up 230%, despite the defeat of the party of “Drill, Baby, Drill!” Harvey adds that both defense stocks and large-cap banks, normally regarded as partial to Republicans and not Democrats, have outperformed by more than 66% under Biden. “These relative performances,” he says, “have been entirely at odds with the conventional political wisdom/outlooks as they relate to clean energy/climate change, defense spending levels, and financial market regulations under a Democrat administration.”For another illustration, look at how Smith & Wesson, the ultimate pure-play gun stock, and a leading clean energy ETF have performed since  Trump won the election in 2016. Despite his close allegiance to the Second Amendment, Smith & Wesson tanked during his term. Meanwhile, the the rise and fall of clean energy is almost the inverse of what would have been expected under Trump (who made a point of leaving the Paris climate agreement) and Biden (who has pledged huge sums of federal money to alternative energy):\nLong story short, it’s really not worth trying to predict how various political outcomes might affect individual stocks. When it comes to asset allocation, however, it might be different.\n      Surviving 2024\nHow exactly will the campaign affect the next nine months? It’s been a popular call that the Federal Reserve would do what it could to help Biden. That presumably involves cutting rates, and so Trump’s growing political ascendancy has added to the confidence with which investors have bet on a Fed pivot. Jerome Powell and his colleagues have managed to douse speculation that cuts are coming as soon as next month, and are dealing with intense questions about their independence. Slashing rates before it’s obvious that it’s safe to do so would only invite invective from Trump and compromise any sense of the Fed’s independence. In any case, monetary policy works with a lag; interest rate cuts now are unlikely to improve the economy in any perceptible way before the election.Therefore, the simplistic notion of the Fed cutting to help its friend in the White House looks far-fetched. But there are other ways that politics could move the Fed. Stock ownership by Americans is almost back to its highs before the 2008 crisis shattered confidence. That means that the so-called  “wealth effect” is real.\nWith their  401(k)s and IRAs in great shape, Americans are wealthier and spend accordingly. It’s very useful that they do so at a time of high budget deficits. A stock market crash in the next nine months would likely doom Biden’s chances (much as it did John McCain’s in 2008). It would also wreck the Fed’s hopes of securing an economic soft landing. The last few weeks have shown that the market is anxious about the short-term rates outlook. Stocks took a dive after Powell said that a March cut was unlikely, then rallied to fresh records after Wednesday’s big 10-year Treasury auction passed off well. Whatever the Fed’s motivation, the political rise of Trump is a strong force toward lower rates over the next nine months. Rather than risk a crash, the central bank might acquiesce in permitting a melt-up.\n      And After the Election...\nWhat happens to economic policy after a Trump victory? In his first term, he appointed Powell, a sitting Fed governor, as chair, even though there were candidates who would have represented a big change from the status quo. Various Goldman Sachs alumni served as economic advisers, overseeing a policy largely in line with Republican orthodoxy. But a second term could be very different. Trump has said that he  wouldn’t reappoint Powell, and analysts are braced for a potential sharp politicization of the central bank.Marko Papic of Clocktower Group cautions investors to be ready for Trump 2.0 to mark a big change in direction. With the federal deficit at historic levels, there’s little space for fiscal expansion — but Papic suggests that this is exactly what he might provide, satisfying the demand from his base for economic populism:What are his priorities on the fiscal side? Like how is he stimulating the economy? Well, there is the extension of tax cuts and corporate tax, but I would say that even if he didn’t have any plans, the bond market would still riot. Because one thing we know he may not have plans for, he will want to spend money, and even if he doesn’t, we know one thing he won’t do, which is he is not going to do austerity unless he’s forced to by the bond market. That’s why I’m not bullish on stocks under Trump.On this account, the Fed would then be required to do a mop-up job by buying bonds to stop yields from spiking out of control — or, in other words, yield curve control, a form of financial repression. The immediate effects might be pretty good; the long-term impacts on capitalism less so. For everyone else, the dollar would be weakened, which would be fine for a populist second term, as it would act as an  effective higher tariff  for other countries hoping to import to the US. \n    A weakened dollar would be fine for a populist second term. Photographer: Alex Scott/Bloomberg\nThe main argument against this is that Trump may be mad, but he isn’t stupid. His current program involves taking on the administrative, or “deep,” state, so arguably institutional constraints would weaken. But still. Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research in London argues as follows: I would’ve thought that whoever he appoints as Treasury secretary would advise very strongly against playing fast and loose with the world’s reserve currency that allows the US to borrow more cheaply in the global markets. If you lose that confidence in the underlying institutions of the United States because of political interference in the Federal Reserve, then there would be a high price to pay for that. I doubt that President Trump will do that; I think he might surprise people by a fairly conventional choice.Trump needs to be taken seriously but not literally, to borrow another phrase. His rhetoric suggests that he’ll try harder to do economic populism properly this time, but past behavior suggests he wouldn’t take things too far. Markets have not priced in any such outcome. They must in any case guard against the real possibility of a  second Biden term with a Republican Congress, which would probably result in austerity, an outcome with very different risks. Any and every indication of where Trump will fall on this continuum will   move markets. Buckle up.  —Reporting by Richard Abbey\n      "

        "content": "        China’s stock rally is a long way from a dragon. History of market intervention isn’t a sign of healthy capitalism. People are selling volat\n      Today’s Points:\n\tChina’s stock rally is a long way from a dragon.\tHistory of market intervention isn’t a sign of healthy capitalism.\tPeople are selling volatility again; will they ever learn?\tTIP: Last chance to share your favorite love songs before Valentine’s Day. \n      China Rising\nDead cats deserve respect. China’s stock market has just staged a rally for the ages, but after a prolonged fall it looks like a “dead cat bounce” — the charming Wall Street term based on the fact that even a stiffened feline corpse will rebound just a little if you drop it far enough (we can only speculate about a five-story building). But it’s still worth looking at how this happened and what’s been driving the changes.The authorities understandably want to calm conditions that have come close to all-out panic in time for the Lunar New Year holiday, which will keep markets closed for a week starting this Friday as people celebrate the start of the Year of the Dragon. And it seems pretty clear that leaders now regard the falling stock market as a major problem that needs to be solved. The CSI 300 index, the main benchmark for mainland-quoted stocks, rose 3.5% Tuesday, its best day in just over 15 months. The last time it performed better was Nov. 1, 2022, driven by excitement that the   Covid-Zero restrictions would soon be lifted. Although based only on unsourced  reports on social media, it was what traders wanted to hear. \nThe spark for the fire this time was news that President Xi Jinping would be meeting with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to discuss ways to prop up the stock market. That followed the announcement of a ban on securities lending (thwarting attempts to sell short), and also the news that one of China’s sovereign wealth funds was pouring money into exchange-traded funds. This chart from colleagues shows the way the news flow buoyed Shanghai and Shenzhen throughout Tuesday’s rally:\nHow seriously to take this? It could merely be a dead cat bounce. There’s still a long way to go before making a clear break from the downward direction of travel that took hold a year ago as it grew evident that post-Covid reopening wouldn’t be as powerful as hoped. There’s nothing scientific about the trend channel I drew on this chart from the terminal; the point is that this move is still consistent with ongoing deterioration: \nContinuing the comparison: The last time A-shares leapt like this, it was also on the basis of a rumor that the authorities were about to do something. That turned out to be true. But the end of Covid Zero didn’t have the positive effects, at least on the economy, that had been hoped. This time around, the regulators sparked genuine excitement. Inflows into onshore equities on Tuesday totaled more than 10 times the day before. Money also seems to have come into the stock market from bonds, with Chinese 10-year yields jumping on Tuesday. But as with stocks, in context it’s still way too soon to proclaim that the bull market in Chinese bonds is over:\nLike the post-Covid reopening, the issue is whether any forthcoming stimulus fulfills all hopes placed in it. The history of the government’s attempts to use the stock market as a tool of economic policy is not encouraging. China is a capitalist economy, but one that still has extremely Chinese (meaning communist) characteristics. There is a record of concerted efforts to juice the economy, generally through credit expansion, that have been startlingly successful. Most famously, the stimulus in late 2008, as the world recoiled from the Global Financial Crisis, sent the CSI 300 up 132% in nine months. But the problem is that state attempts to use equity markets as a tool of economic policy tend not to work, and distort the economy when they do. That rally in 2008 followed an extraordinary sequence in which the CSI first gained 525% in 21 months, and then tanked 72% over the next 12. The government’s efforts to prod the market up and then down served to show how blunt its instruments were.Then there was another bubble in 2015, as equities surged by 148% in 12 months, fueled by hopes that MSCI would at last steer foreign investors’ money into Chinese A-shares by including them in the MSCI Emerging Markets index used as the de facto basic portfolio by huge numbers of both passive and active international investors. That would have helped deal with China’s debt overhang by effectively allowing banks to convert the debt into equity, which they could sell to foreigners. When MSCI didn’t play ball, however, the CSI 300 nosedived, contributing to the conditions that prompted a surprise devaluation and a spasm that coursed throughout global markets. After the burst bubbles of 2007 and 2015, A-shares went sideways for years:\nIt’s possible that authorities will over-egg the pudding again, and send the stock market up into yet another bubble. History suggests that  this is more likely in China than most other places. But they’ve made it clear that they’re loath to do this. What Xi and his colleagues really want is to clean up the property sector and thwart any risk of a financial crisis, a fact underlined by the  fate of the property developer China Evergrande. Inflating an equity bubble would directly cut against this. A messier outcome in which stocks bobble sideways for years, much as they did after 2010 and 2016, is at least as likely. But it’s certainly true that it would be great to be in the market if it does turn into another bubble.  For the longer term, investors might want to ponder whether they really wish to invest in a market that appears wholly beholden to help from regulators, and leaps at the first suggestion that the government will be propping it up. So far, nobody seems to be suggesting that the reforms the CSRC has in mind involve improving corporate governance and strengthening shareholders’ rights, or taking measures to make it harder for the government to intervene in the private sector. Rather, they’re about making it harder to sell stock or manage risk; the measures to entice investors are fundamentally shareholder-unfriendly. Banning short sellers is often a first resort, but it’s a sticking plaster at the very best. It was the first step US authorities took after the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008; the fall in stocks was arrested for about one day.\n    The dragon is a long way from turning into a bull. Photographer: China News Service/China News Service\nAny rally like Tuesday’s (followed at the time of writing by a  more subdued Wednesday session but with no big counter-move) needs to be taken seriously. It shows people have an appetite to buy, and that the government wants to prod them in that direction. But until this moment, none of the measures causing excitement gives any good reason to believe that China can stage a prolonged bull market. There’s no proof yet that this market is a dragon, and not a dead cat. \n      Finger on the (MLIV) Pulse\nIt’s quiet. Maybe too quiet. Remember “Volmageddon?” Six years ago, the popular trade of betting on volatility to stay low imploded spectacularly and a group of short-vol exchange-traded funds (which leveraged up buying options to bet on the VIX volatility index to go down) went out of business. During 2017, one of the calmest years for markets on record as there appeared to be a synchronized global recovery, that strategy worked really well. Then it didn’t:\nThe day the roof fell in was Feb. 5, when a few days of stock declines (and therefore an increase in the VIX from a very low level) dislodged many of the inverse ETFs’ bets. Several funds were following this strategy, but all of them were out of business by the end of the month. The incident proved to be the start of a difficult and volatile year that would end with the stock market revolting against new Chair Jerome Powell’s plans to keep reducing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. \nYou would have thought the episode would be enough to deter all and sundry from making leveraged bets against volatility for a generation. Make that six years. Now,   the wagers on market calm are back, this time through income ETFs, which couple straight exposure to the stock market with selling options that protect the buyer against stock declines. Do people ever learn? Or is it possible that the act has been cleaned up this  time, and that we aren’t heading for another accident?All who read the Bloomberg terminal now now have the chance to air their opinion through the MLIV Pulse survey. Are you concerned about the massive accumulation of the short-vol bets? Do you think the US stock market will stay calm? Do the option-selling ETFs present a bigger threat to markets than the leveraged or crypto ones? Please share your views. The questionnaire can be found here, and the results will be out next week. Thanks in advance for your participation. \n      "

(What else is new?)ALSO: Richard Abbey joins Points of Return.TODAY’S TIP: Readers haven’t had enough of silly love songs. \n      America First, Yet Again…\nGood times, bad times, all add up to buying the US. Or so it seems. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, took to broadcast media Sunday night on CBS’s venerable 60 Minutes. There, viewers tuning in early for the  Grammys got to hear ever more clearly that they needn’t expect a rate cut next month, or more than three this year. “The prudent thing to do,” he said, “is to just give it some time and see that the data continue to confirm that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustainable way.”That message soon received extra validation from other Fed speakers. Then it got some help from the data. The Institute of Supply Managers’ survey of the services sector came in far stronger than expected, ramming home the point that in many ways, the economy barely seems to be slowing at all. In the context of a central bank that just wants to make sure that inflation really is on its way to 2%, the number that managers reported for the prices they had to pay was particularly revealing. While no longer at any kind of historical extreme, it’s now back on a sharply rising trend. This is how such prices have moved since the survey started (with 50 set as the border between expansion and contraction):\nThe jump of 7.3 points was the biggest month-to-month change since August 2012, so this suggests rude economic health. It’s possible this was a fluke, and there will be one more such report before the Fed meets next month. But for now, it tilts the scales firmly against an imminent rate cut. Come the afternoon, and the Fed published its quarterly opinion survey of senior lending officers (universally known as the SLOOS). A majority of bankers reported that they were tightening lending standards. Demand for corporate and industrial loans was falling. That’s not great. Yet in both cases, the problem wasn’t intensifying. The proportion of banks expecting to tighten declined, as did those who found reducing demand for credit. As ever in markets, the direction of travel is important, and it was encouraging:\nThis survey matters. Strong tightening of lending standards, as happened early last year around the time of the banking crisis that claimed Silicon Valley Bank and a few others, is strongly linked over time with subsequent economic slowdowns. If the banks are being less generous about handing out credit, you can generally expect people to lose jobs in the aftermath. It’s part of the rhythm of the economy. As this chart from the Bloomberg terminal demonstrates, spikes in the number of banks tightening credit tend to be followed within a matter of months by a rise in unemployment. This time, the jobless rate is still bumping along the bottom while the situation for the banks is already growing  less severe. This is great news for economic growth, but not if you’re desperate for the Fed to cut rates. If the banks aren’t crunching credit, then there’s no need for the Fed to ease policy:\nWhy exactly has last spring’s brief banking implosion left so little mark on the economy? George Saravelos, chief foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, points out that the US has made itself far less dependent than other economies on banks, and instead relies much more on the capital markets:A key driver behind   US growth exceptionalism is the economy's massively reduced sensitivity to interest rate hikes compared to the rest of the world. The 2010-2020 decade of Fed QE led to a big reduction in private sector interest rate risk, mostly thanks to the capital market intensity of the US economy. He offers this extraordinary chart to show that the amount that American companies have to pay in interest expense has fallen, significantly, even during the steep rise in rates of the last two years:\nThe US is the only advanced economy where interest expense has come down like this. Saravelos points out that the net financial obligations of households are also lower than at any time in three decades. In economies where banks still control the lion’s share of credit to companies, such as Western Europe, tightening standards would have led to more of a slowdown, and thence to earlier rate cuts. In the US, there is evidence that higher rates don’t seem to be that much of a burden — and that implies that the Fed can safely wait a little longer to ensure that inflation really is under control. The point for Saravelos is that the real debate shouldn’t be over whether the Fed cuts as soon as March (which always seemed a stretch), but “if it cuts by less or more than the rest of the world over the next two years.” He sees the risks as skewed toward less Fed tightening and therefore a stronger dollar. And indeed, the dollar index celebrated a day that saw traders sharply reduce their bets on cuts by going back above its 200-day moving average. \nThe strength of the economy counteracted the shift upward in rates enough to drive another big day for Big Tech and maintain strong US stock performance compared to the rest of the world. The danger coming swiftly down the pike is overheating. For now, it remains dangerous to stand in the way of the US juggernaut.\n      From Michigan, With Love\nThe University of Michigan, home of the national champion Wolverines and near-neighbor of the tragic Detroit Lions, knows a thing or two about sentiment. Its latest survey of consumers shows that Americans were beginning to feel a bit better about the economy, although the number still seemed low given the robust strength in official data. And   as Points of Return has reported, we need to take into account political polarization. The latest numbers show that it’s growing even wider.Since 2017, the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, the Michigan researchers have asked their interviewees about partisan identification. That proves to make a big difference. This is a current assessment of economic conditions (i.e. how are things now, a practical question that shouldn’t be influenced by politics), split between Democrats, Republicans and Independents. The divergence is remarkable:\nThe most important line for campaigners on both sides might be the Independents. As they still perceive things to be worse than in the pandemic summer of 2020 (which is simply not the case, unless the data are flat wrong), it’s plain that the “vibecession” phenomenon is about more than loyal Republicans giving negative answers. It’s a decent bet that the winning party in November will be determined by whether Independents move closer to optimistic Democrats or doom-laden Republicans.The gap between the current perceptions offered by Democrats and Republicans shows polarization at a new high:\nAgain, this isn’t a disagreement about what the government should be doing for the future, or who is more likely to win the next election. It’s about how people describe things as they are now. In early 2017, the gap was negligible. No more.It’s a shame that Michigan didn’t ask the regular political identity question earlier. In a very interesting podcast for 538 (at least for anyone who shares my nerdy interest in sentiment data), you can hear the economist in charge of the survey admit that it just didn’t seem important until 2017. It’s quite possible that she and her colleagues were right about that. It’s obviously important now. \n      More Housekeeping\nToday we welcome Richard Abbey as the new Points of Return reporter. Richard is a veteran of 10 years building journalism in his native Ghana. He worked at the Business and Financial Times and Citi FM, some of the biggest media organizations in the West African country. He was at the forefront of some of stories that spanned Ghana’s several Eurobond issuances, an economic bailout program with the International Monetary Fund, and a central bank-led financial sector restructuring that nearly halved the number of licensed institutions.Richard joined Bloomberg in 2022 following his data journalism degree at the Columbia Journalism School. As we shift focus to doing a lot more data journalism and data visualization, his expertise combined with his unique experience will no doubt come in very handy. We have already discussed a number of projects and I can’t wait to share the outcome once they’re ready. \n      "

Seemingly beyond Earth’s gravitational pull, they are now testing the laws of physics (with the exception of Tesla Inc., which is suddenly succumbing to gravity). In language indebted to science fiction, some well-established market relationships are shifting.Bond yields jolted higher on Friday, thanks to a strong jobs report (of which more later). What effect did they have on the stock market? Tech stocks had a great day. Recall that the popular argument has been that higher long-term yields are particularly harmful for “long-duration” companies, such as big tech groups. Most of their value is in future earnings, which must be discounted at a higher rate. Thus big tech did badly in 2022 as yields rose, and well in 2023 as they came back under control. And so far this year, yields have risen — and so have these stocks. This nifty chart is from Michael Hartnett of BofA Securities: \nOver history, it’s important to point out that there isn’t a particularly strong relationship between changes in 10-year yields and the Nasdaq. But 2024’s combination of a bounce in yields and a great time for the Nasdaq is very unusual. The only more extreme instance came in 1999, when markets partied ahead of a burst bubble the next year. In general, this combination either happens after a bad recession (as in 2009) as yields rise and people also buy stocks, or in a bubble when people just don’t care. Hartnett’s chart is through Jan. 29, or last Monday. It will be quite a bit more extreme now, after Friday’s Nasdaq surge. That was largely thanks to the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc.), which led the market rebound in the first half of 2023. After leveling out for the last six months, final quarter results (which we now have from all bar Nvidia) were enough to bring the Seven to a fresh record relative to the rest of the market, using Bloomberg indexes:\nHow big a deal are the Magnificent Seven? Hartnett points out that they’re jointly worth more than the combined gross domestic product of New York, Tokyo, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka, and Shanghai.  Meta’s gain in market cap on Friday after its results was only just short of $200 billion (about the current market cap of the whole of Cisco Systems Inc.). That’s the largest one-day gain in value for any company ever. But it’s true that   the Seven are growing more differentiated as they compete against each other. Investors are beginning to assess exactly which ones will reap benefits from artificial intelligence. Last year, that competition saw Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, challenge Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to  a cage match. The fight never happened, but financially, Zuckerberg has been inflicting a bruising ever since. Suddenly, the market says Meta is worth more than twice as much as Tesla:\nBefore Meta’s blowout results, the Seven accounted for 45% of the S&P 500’s advance for the year — but the Magnificent Six, excluding Tesla, made up 71%, according to Hartnett. These are strange times. BofA suggests a “barbell” strategy of holding some of the big tech names and balancing them with investments that might do well if the bubble bursts. After 1999, that proved to be value stocks and emerging markets. They might prosper again. —Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      Surprise, Surprise!\nJust when you thought it was safe to buy bonds, this happens. The 10-year Treasury yield, the world’s most important financial benchmark, dropped back below 4% last week, in a move that foretold easier financial conditions. Then came the announcement of the unemployment data for January, along with revisions to the data that came before it, and the effect on the bond market was immediate:\nEvidently, the number came as a surprise. Sharp moves like that don’t happen otherwise. But in the greater scheme of things, the payrolls data merely   moved the bond market back to where it had been for most of the year so far. That implies at least a little dubiousness about how much the report can be relied on. That’s fair because on its face, it suggests that the increasingly plausible   narrative of a steadily slowing jobs market, backed by numerous threads of data over the last few months, needs to be thrown out. An extra 353,000 people were added to American payrolls last month. And while these numbers are notoriously subject to revision, it’s notable that the December payrolls were revised sharply upward. The labor market isn’t decelerating; if anything, it’s gaining speed again. This led traders to cut back sharply the probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next month — although after Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on such a prospect last week, and this data, it’s perhaps surprising that markets perceive any chance of a cut at all: \nSuch numbers automatically weaken the case for cuts by demonstrating that current financial conditions aren’t getting in the way of people finding jobs. If policy is working manifestly well, why risk changing it? Within the data, the strongest argument against cuts came from wages. The Fed has consistently put the labor market at the center of its attempt to limit inflation. This follows one of the most famous economic models, the  Phillips Curve, which shows a trade-off between inflation and unemployment; more people in work would mean higher inflation and vice versa. The mechanism supposed to make it work is the wage market. With prices rising, in a strong labor market workers can negotiate higher wages to compensate, and that will push prices up further. That’s the theory.The nastiest surprise in the data was a rebound in the rate of increase of average hourly earnings. It’s still way above pre-pandemic levels, and far too high for the central bank. The question is how best to measure them. The following chart compares rises in average hourly earnings with the overall wage inflation shown by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Tracker survey, which uses census data, going back 2007. One advantage of this approach is obvious. The average-hourly earnings number is prone to compositional effects, so when many low-paid workers were laid off at the beginning of the pandemic, it automatically increased (and appeared to decrease a year later once this effect dropped out). That incident aside, the two numbers are deviating by the most in their shared history. Both also suggest that consumers should be much happier than they currently are, as they’re receiving raises well ahead of inflation: \nStandard Chartered Plc’s strategist Steven Englander offered some very interesting research on this last month. First, if you take the average-hourly earnings number, and also the employment cost index, and deflate them by the consumer price index, we find that wages are barely ahead now of where they were on the eve of the pandemic. In the three preceding years, real wages had risen steadily:\nAs for the Atlanta Fed numbers that suggest things are better still, Englander finds an “implicit sampling bias.” To be in the sample, an individual must have been working for the entire year. This leaves out workers who were unemployed 12 months earlier but took jobs, as well as labor force re-entrants and newcomers. It is possible that this job continuity is associated with higher wage growth.Taken together, this might help explain why so many in the US still seem disaffected with an economy that looks so strong. Wage rises are still not covering the increase in out-of-pocket expenses, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, and people are still feeling the effects.\n      Housekeeping\nThank you for reading this newsletter, and particular thanks to those who helped by filling in our audience survey late last year. Gratifyingly, nobody seems to want us to make big changes, so we won’t; but it did produce a few suggestions, such as starting with an executive summary, trimming back the length, and doing more data journalism and visualization, which we will experiment with in the next few weeks. It also revealed that I was remiss in not explaining the role of the invaluable Isabelle Lee, who came aboard as reporter for the newsletter back in July 2022, and is now moving on. We’ll introduce her replacement tomorrow.To be clear as I should have been before — ultimate responsibility for all the judgments in this newsletter rests with me. In the (very rare) event that Isabelle wrote something I disagreed with, it was changed. But she has been a full partner (or more) in the reporting that goes into it. When pieces have been signed by Isabelle alone, that’s because I couldn’t find anything significant worth changing. They were her work. I’m sorry I wasn’t clear about this, and I hope she gets the credit she deserves. I’m profoundly grateful for the great working relationship we’ve enjoyed over the last 18 months.

That seems to be true of the latest wave of results from Big Tech, with the first-quarter\n      Constructive Ambiguity\nSometimes there’s no room for financial ambiguity. That seems to be true of the latest wave of results from Big Tech, with the first-quarter earnings of both Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. received rapturously after Thursday’s market close. It’s not true of the broader fate of the global economy, where the latest data leaves much to interpretation. If you want to predict that rates aren’t coming down as quickly as everyone seems to think, you could use the latest Institute of Supply Managers surveys of the manufacturing sector. In the US, new orders and prices unexpectedly turned up sharply, suggesting that the sector wasn’t contracting, and that some inflationary pressures might still be around. The proportion of businesses complaining about rising prices was the highest in nine months:\nIf you’d rather the Federal Reserve and other big central banks started to cut rates at the next opportunity, then you can use the data on claims for jobless insurance in the US. As good an up-to-date measure of layoffs as we have, it signals that total claims are rising again, and close to a two-year high. As the Fed obviously cares about the half of its mandate devoted to full employment, this looks like an argument to start easing:\nThe US Non-Farm Payrolls data for January, due hours after this is published, could clarify things, but probably won’t. Meanwhile, commercial real estate — especially office property — is back as a cause of great angst, thanks to a shocking loan loss provision of $550 million from New York Community Bank earlier this week. Office property has led the relative performance of regional banks over the last year. Lenders tanked in March 2023 as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and others ran into trouble due to real estate loans, and their performance has moved in line with office property ever since:\nThis has broader ramifications for asset allocation. Any problem for banks increases the chances of more liquidity from the Fed, which has only just discontinued the term lending support it gave them last year. All else being equal, emergency liquidity should be good for bonds relative to stocks. And so it has proved. The last few days have seen one of bonds’ strongest rallies since last March:\nIt’s not just NYCB. As Bloomberg   reported, banks in Germany and Japan are also taking hits from their exposure to US commercial real estate. And the anecdotal evidence is that big institutions are washing their hands of the sector. Boston Properties Inc.’s earnings call earlier this week  revealed that it had purchased a 29% interest in 360 Park Avenue South, an office block in a prestigious midtown Manhattan location, for $1,  from its previous joint-venture partner Canadian Public Pension Investment Board. The pension fund, one of the most respected and influential in the world, had invested $71 million in the property. While this was doubtless good business for Boston Properties, it can only be alarming that a large institution is prepared to take a loss on such a scale to rid itself of a midtown Manhattan office block. It also raises the awkward question of what investors who don’t have CPPIB’s C$576 billion ($431 billion) in total assets might do when confronting the possibility of a $71 million loss. Is the commercial property mess enough to change the course of monetary policy? The SVB crisis appeared that way at the time, but the Fed raised rates twice in its aftermath. Ajay Rajadhyaksha of Barclays Capital Inc. likened these events to Groundhog Day, and suggested this incident, like last year’s, had been overblown:While the March event was all about interest rate risk, the next one was supposed to be about office commercial real estate (CRE) loans. We were inundated by questions about how bad fundamentals in office CRE were, what the overall exposure for the US banking sector was, and whether it was the catalyst that would spark a continued banking crisis. We argued that these fears were unfounded… The numbers were simply not large enough (especially given how rental lease rolls were staggered) to rise to the level of a macro issue that would spark sharp Fed easing.He sticks by that call, and does not believe this need become a true macro event. NYCB’s problems appear idiosyncratic, while CRE’s lack of transparency tends to make it easier to believe the worst for a while. He describes it as a “black box for macro investors,” where many loans aren’t securitized (and hence don’t publish regular data) while the underlying assets are a “mishmash” including not only office buildings, but also multi-family apartments, hotels, malls, data centers, and warehouses. As such, investors can “easily be surprised by an individual bank suddenly reporting a sharp rise in charge-offs.”Then, the lack of transparency can feed on itself, as happened last March and appears to be happening again. It’s still not clear that commercial real estate is a transformative issue, and for the time being, with stocks enjoying a good day, the bet appears to be that US banks are not going to bring down the economy. That’s an opinion that should be strengthened by the latest tech results…\n      The $200 Billion After-Hours Session\nTwo days. It took only two days for Big Tech to prove markets wrong. (And make some lucky people a lot of money in the process). Stellar earnings from two members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com, sparked dramatic rallies in after-hours trading, a mirror to Tuesday’s after-hours selloff for Google parent Alphabet Inc. Apple Inc., whose China sales slump spooked investors, was a fly in the ointment, but not enough to spoil the excitement.For Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the headlines were hogged by the company’s plans to buy back an additional $50 billion in shares, and issue its first-ever quarterly dividend. That can be interpreted as a way to convince investors that the firm’s costly bets on the metaverse and artificial intelligence will eventually pay off. It might also be an attempt to bolster the CEO’s reputation on Wall Street after his bruising interrogation by Congress this week. Paying a first dividend is often interpreted as an admission that a company’s initial period of strongest growth is over, and it’s now better to hand back cash rather than reinvest it. It’s unusual to pay a first dividend at a point when the share price has more than doubled in a year.  “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.” The social media giant also reported strong fourth-quarter results, posting a 25% gain in sales, and profits that tripled, while   also projecting revenue growth for the current period that surpassed expectations.Shares jumped 14% in extended trading. As Meta’s market cap had just re-passed the $1 trillion mark, this implies that Friday could see an increase of $142 billion in its total value. For context, that rise is roughly equivalent to the entire current market cap of Morgan Stanley, General Electric Co. or Philip Morris International Inc.As for Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, strong sales and an operating income outlook that beat estimates boosted the shares. Like Meta, this might have had something to do with the company’s newfound discipline in how it used its cash, rather than merely its ability to boost profits. As colleague Spencer Soper said, the response could be credited to Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s “unrelenting cost-cutting and focus on services that make money” that are reshaping a “once free-spending company.” Those cost-trimming efforts include more than 35,000 job cuts.Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit, rebounded after several disappointing quarters. And in a bid to diversify revenue, Amazon has “intensified its effort to generate advertising on its shopping website and last month began airing commercials on the Prime Video streaming service.” Advertising sales gained 27%, accelerating for the fourth straight quarter. Shares climbed 7% in extended trading, implying a rise of about  $112 billion in market cap: \nApple was a different story, largely because of its greater exposure to China. Tim Cook’s firm reported sales there dropped 13% in the fiscal first quarter, far short of what analysts predicted. It was the weakest three-month period since the first quarter of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic first hit. Apple may have avoided a fifth-straight quarter of declines, but shares still dropped about 3% after hours.The bottom line is investors are still not prepared to give Magnificent Seven companies the benefit of the doubt. If convinced, however, as applies to Meta and Amazon, there seems to be no limit to the value they will place on them. And it’s ever clearer that the giant tech companies have taken on true macroeconomic significance. It can’t be often that two of them simultaneously announce quarterly results so strong that investors write up their value by more than $100 billion.  — Isabelle Lee\n      "

        "content": "        The fed funds rate is unlikely to be cut in March when the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision makers hold their next meeting. We can\n      Curb Your Enthusiasm\nThe fed funds rate is unlikely to be cut in March when the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision makers hold their next meeting. We can say that with some clarity because Chair Jerome Powell voiced it in as many words, saying that it was “not the most likely case or the base case.” The  official Federal Open Market Committee statement erased language it had used previously that it held a bias toward more hikes, but that had been universally expected. Such clear guidance for March had not been, and it had an impact.The stock market appeared to have put more weight on imminent cuts than anyone else. A busy day had already included: results from Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., news of serious difficulties for New York Community Bank that pushed its stock down 45%, an announcement from the Treasury that it was going to be auctioning over the next three months somewhat more longer-term bonds than had been expected, and macro news suggesting the labor market might be cooling down a bit. Despite all of this, the circumstantial evidence  is that it was Powell’s words on a March cut that substantially did all the damage:\nStocks had the worst day in some months. Meanwhile, bonds enjoyed a rally, swallowing the bond supply news without difficulty. Instead, the fears around New York Community Bank sent people rushing to buy Treasuries, largely on the theory that renewed banking trouble would force the Fed to ease. Yields rose during Powell’s press conference, without getting back to their previous high, and then sank as traders shifted positions for the end of the month: \nThis was a vintage risk-off day, with money moving out of stocks and into bonds.   The problems at NYCB, which  took over some of the assets of the failed Signature Bank last year, played a big role. A loan-loss provision of $550 million, mostly for real estate,  came as a nasty shock, and drove a big asset-allocation move. If we use the SPY and TLT exchange-traded funds as proxies for the S&P 500 and for Treasury bonds of 20 years or more, we find that this was the sharpest risk-off day since the sudden raft of bank failures last March:\nThere were plenty of cross-currents, but the nerves over Big Tech also mattered a lot. To quote Peter van Dooijeweert, head of defensive and tactical alpha at Man Group: “Regional banks are very weak. Usually, when regional banks blow up you're supposed to buy tech. And when bonds rally you're supposed to buy tech.” Wednesday’s trading was therefore a big exception to the rule, largely because tech companies are failing to fulfill their rosiest earnings expectations. Meanwhile, the shift in expectations for rate cuts is much less than at first appears. The implied odds on a March move rose to two-in-three and then fell to one-in-three during the day, but things weren’t so different at the close of trading. This is the implicit odds of a March hike or cut, as calculated from fed funds futures by the Bloomberg World Interest Rate Probabilities (WIRP) function:\nFor the longer term, Powell sounded enthusiastic enough about the chances that inflation was beaten that expectations actually moved toward a rather more aggressive series of cuts. December saw a big shift that was subsequently dialed back. The fed funds futures curve ended Wednesday predicting more cuts by the end of the year than it had on Tuesday — it’s now close to the optimism registered at the start of 2024: \nAs for the day’s data, it generally aligned with a soft landing. Most importantly, the employment cost index, covering the full expense of employing people, had its smallest increase in two years during the last quarter of 2023. It was the acceleration of this measure late in 2021 that appeared to jolt the Fed toward hiking, so this is significant:\nUltimately, Powell repeated several times that he thought the improvement in inflation data was good, but that he needed more — not necessarily better data. The subtext is that he’s determined not to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s and cut too soon, particularly when (unlike back then) there are no problems in the employment market. Once the Fed has seen enough, he made clear that the FOMC would probably cut several times this year (he mentioned that in the “dot-plot,” the median FOMC member called for three cuts). In other words, he’s doing a good job of threading the needle, and calibrating a response that will allow an economic soft landing.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander, offered, I think, a reasonable summary:Powell was very clear. The data seen over the past six months on core inflation (core PCE deflator running at a 1.9% annualized rate) is exactly what the Fed is hoping to see, but policymakers simply need to see more. The passage of time and continued benign readings are necessary to move the Fed to begin to cut rates. I can confidently forecast that time will pass, but, I doubt that the inflation data will be as good over the next six months as it was in the last six, which is why I believe that easing will come later than the market is currently pricing.As Stanley points out, risks have not gone away. Macro data surprises could change things in either direction, and if NYCB proves the harbinger of serious problems for banking, then rates will need to come down quicker. As for the stock market, Wednesday’s events underlined how much it has come to rely on the big-tech names.Between the market’s Thursday close and Friday’s open, traders will have to deal with results from Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., and with the January non-farm payroll figures. There’s plenty more excitement ahead.   — Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      Elon Musk and the Perils of Anti-ESG\nWithin hours on Wednesday, Delaware and New Hampshire, two of the smallest states in the union, hit important blows for the power of investors, and the ability of shareholders to exert influence over the companies they own. A Delaware court’s decision to uphold a shareholder complaint, and invalidate   the ludicrous $55 billion pay package that Tesla Inc. agreed in 2018 to pay Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, is a breathtaking story, but also an uplifting one.   Tesla’s corporate governance has long been highly questionable — to put it mildly — even if Musk’s sheer omnipresence in contemporary life makes him a valuable asset.In New Hampshire, a committee of the state’s House of Representatives  voted 16-0 to recommend blocking legislation that would have made it a   criminal offense for the state’s pension funds to invest on an ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) basis. That means that New Hampshire’s investment managers might, after all, be allowed to avoid companies with poor corporate governance (like, maybe, Tesla).  The broader message is that the wave of uncritical adulation for ESG investing has been followed by an even more overblown wave of support for anti-ESG measures, and that common sense might just be starting a fightback. The precise wording of New Hampshire’s proposed bill made it a criminal offense to invest “based on non-financial considerations (that) may include environmental, social and governance criteria, which have shown to produce lower returns compared to investment decisions based on financial considerations alone.”First, note that it’s contentious whether ESG factors really do lead to worse returns. The academic literature is still unclear, but anyone who wants to do ESG investing can find a report from somewhere that will justify their approach. Second, note that New Hampshire was setting out to invalidate investing on the basis of governance, even though that does have very direct financial effects. Did it really mean that investors couldn’t take into account Tesla’s dreadful corporate governance and decide not to invest, or that shareholders couldn’t take action against excessive pay awards?Finally, and most important, it would have erased all “non-financial considerations.” Anti-ESG at this point amounts to a hugely prescriptive attempt to strip managers of all their discretion, and appears to have a naive belief that there is one clear financial approach to maximize returns. This is a little like the notion that there was one agreed version of “science” that needed to be followed during the pandemic.The point of active investing is to try to find areas where the herd has it wrong, and to spot factors that could help a company do better than might be predicted from its current financials alone. The last two decades have seen an academic arms race as finance professors have tried to identify investment factors that lead to better performance. In 2015,  research led by Campbell Harvey of Duke University identified 316 putative factors in the literature. Many relied on data-mining, and others found smaller anomalies that could soon be arbitraged away — although not without making some money for the person doing the arbitraging. Big Data, and the increased opportunities offered by machine learning and artificial intelligence have permitted fund managers to go ever further in search of an edge. Many of these factors would fit under an ESG umbrella, and the bulk of them are “non-financial.” So a blanket ban on non-financial considerations would have prohibited fund managers from trying their utmost to beat the market — even though that’s exactly what we want them to do.There are deeper dangers in this. Buying index funds is a good starting point for most of us. But big, passive investment can distort markets. Anti-ESG at this point is shifting toward telling investors they mustn’t put money into anything other than big indexes. That would exacerbate herding, and further diminish the market’s ability to distribute capital where it can be best used.With the traditionally pro-business Republican party increasingly believing that it has the right to tell businesses what they can and cannot do, brace for a new battle. Should investment managers be subjected to political pressure over how they invest? Both the ESG and Anti-ESG factions currently seem to have no problem with that. Which is dangerous. Ed Farrington, a New Hampshire-based fund manager and the incoming president, North America, at Impax Asset Management, said this to the committee (as quoted in Pensions & Investments):Criminalizing investment choice and forbidding the inclusion of ESG factors is a close step to substituting the opinions of government officials for the knowledge of investment professionals.Well said.\n      "

All last year, US markets powered through record highs and left their internation\n      US Exceptionalism\nIt’s an oft-used phrase, but investors won’t let go of it. All last year, US markets powered through record highs and left their international peers in the dust. Can this exemplary performance really go on for another year? That depends on who’s asking, but it’s hard to ignore just how various asset classes in America are continuing to outshine the rest of the world. Consider this: The US is currently seeing the widest gap between S&P 500 current earnings yield and MSCI Europe Index ever. Put simply, Europe has never been this cheap versus the US. The earnings yield investors get from European assets looks far more attractive than the American benchmark.\nThe same pattern emerges when comparing 12-month forward price/earnings multiples for the two markets. By Bernstein’s estimate, Europe is trading at an all-time deep discount of 33% compared to its US peers — steeper even than the pre-pandemic discount of 20%. That’s the widest based on the 35-year dataset that Bernstein tracks, and comfortably bigger even than during the Global Financial Crisis:\nA valuation spread is warranted. Roughly 15 years of lower rates have favored the valuation of US equities. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants are all American, and European equities have a poor track record of delivering persistent positive earnings growth. Yet Bernstein noted the gaps in earnings-growth expectations, quality, or the economic outlook are not enough to justify the spread.The verdict?“The valuation spread is likely to narrow in our view,” strategists led by Sarah McCarthy wrote. Timing this is difficult, but several potential catalysts could play out this year, she says. These include earlier-than-forecast central bank cuts in Europe driven by the weaker economy (which begins to look plausible as rates markets are still positioned for the Federal Reserve to loosen first, despite its much stronger economy), tightening of financial conditions in the US, and any disruption in the rally spurred by artificial intelligence on megacap tech shares. So far, they still see investor reluctance toward European equities, evidenced by persistent net outflows.It’s not hard to see why. The US saw the S&P 500 jump 24% last year, while the MSCI Europe only advanced by half of that. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 surged 54% to its best annual gain since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, with the rally continuing this year as the dominant Magnificent Seven scale new highs. “The rally in this market is a US, tech, AI rally,” said Raphael Thuin, head of capital market strategies at Tikehau Capital. “It is broadening a bit but it is still extremely narrow in terms of leadership.”Such concentration leaves markets vulnerable to any stumble by this elite. And it’s not so much their performance alone — it’s the high expectations of them, as Points of Return discussed here. Case in point: On Thursday, two of the tech giants reported and both handily beat estimates. However, shares dropped post-market, indicating that the results weren’t as stellar as investors hoped, colleague Tatiana Darie pointed out. At the time of writing, Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s shares were down 5.8% after the market. Alphabet’s tumble came after revenue from its core search advertising business fell short of estimates, overshadowing an otherwise strong end to 2023. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp.’s cloud growth disappointed some on Wall Street — even if the company posted its strongest revenue growth since 2022. All eyes will now be on Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., which report Thursday. These companies are now so important that their results are treated almost like macroeonomic data. All could be vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, particularly regarding Taiwan, where many of their semiconductors are made. That should be a worthwhile reminder that it’s the big tech groups that really place the US apart. Judging the S&P 500 on an equal-weighted basis (so that the tech giants aren’t weighted higher than anyone else) leaves the European Stoxx 600 more or less on equal terms since the beginning of 2021.\nStripping out that sector paints a far different picture. “US equities remain at all-time highs. But this is not a return to the YOLO behavior of 2021,” strategist Duncan Toms of HSBC wrote. “Cracks are emerging under the hood. Hence, our view is not to chase the latest leg higher, given that: 1) the bar to beat EPS expectations, especially for the US tech sector, is very high (10% q/q); and 2) a possible repricing of rate expectations as there are upside risks to inflation amid shipping disruptions in the Red Sea.” That implies, as most readers will have thought anyway, that the news on the fed funds rate, non-farm payrolls, and the big tech results between now and the weekend could make a significant difference.Some in fact have grown wary on how much more tech can grow from here. Adam Farstrup, head of multi-asset, Americas, at Schroders, is  underweight tech, though underscores that he’s “careful not to be too underweight.” Technology is such a big chunk of the index that a serious underweight would bring the risk of career damage and underperformance compared to peers. His firm has, however, downgraded its outlook on equities to neutral amid expectations of a peak in US interest rates.“It’s true that the US has a clear leadership position in the AI space right now. That part of exceptionalism could continue,” he said. “But if you look at a breakdown in equity performance for 10 years ending 2023, Japan and Europe have better earnings growth than the US.” Marco Pirondini, chief investment officer at Amundi US, suggests that US firms have done at least something to earn their valuations:American companies are managed very, very well. And the size of the American economy for sure provides for economies of scale that are difficult in other markets… All the private equity, the venture capital and the animal spirits that exist in the US provide a level of innovation that honestly doesn’t exist anywhere else... This has been like that for a long, long time. And when you look the next three years, I think that the differential in valuations will become so extreme that I expect a normalization in these relative valuations.So how far can US exceptionalism stretch? For Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: “The answer to that is that it has already continued for longer than almost anyone expected. It won’t go on forever, but we have little choice but to wait and see when cracks start to appear.”He points out that European growth expectations are tanking by comparison. That should strengthen the dollar and thus continue the outperformance of dollar-denominated assets. Meanwhile, implicit forecasts for where the target rates of the Fed and the European Central Bank would have reached by June have started to shift away from the belief that the Fed will be cutting first, and the gap between them will narrow — which should also help the dollar and be bad news for euro-denominated assets:\nThere is also the fact that US credit spreads are currently tighter (lower) than Europe’s, despite the heavy borrowing being undertaken by American corporates. European companies remain more likely to use bank finance, which should make their bonds somewhat lower risk. “This is very unusual,” said Tikehau’s Thuin. “European credit spreads are typically tighter than US because indices are of better quality. Put differently, US assets are more expensive because there is more growth, better resilience, less impacted by geopolitics.”\nFor now, it seems as if most of the world has avoided entering this most-awaited recession. The International Monetary Fund for its part raised its forecast for global growth this year, citing better-than-expected expansion in the US and fiscal stimulus in China. The world economy will grow 3.1% this year, up from the 2.9% seen in October, the IMF said. By now, investors know for a fact that growth occurs in various phases.But it’s still the US whose data is coming in furthest ahead of expectations, as illustrated by the Citi Economic Surprise indexes:\nTo Don Rissmiller of Strategas Research Partners, the world is trying for what he calls an “economic landing.” How might this appear? “In some countries, this looks like a hard landing (China), and elsewhere, it has been bumpy (e.g., Europe). But the US is seeing solid growth with tame inflation — that’s the pathway to a soft landing, especially given developing fiscal cushions (e.g., as the current tax bill being considered in DC) and likely Fed rate cuts in 2024.”Or put differently, it’s still going to take a lot of guts to bet against American exceptionalism. —Isabelle Lee\n      "

The attack in Jordan that left three US soldiers dead, apparently perpetrated by Iran-backed forces,\n      World War III Is Drawing Near…\nIs Dr. Strangelove really back with us? The attack in Jordan that left three US soldiers dead, apparently perpetrated by Iran-backed forces, has ratcheted global fears to a new level. Retired Adm. James Stavridis’s column for Bloomberg Opinion makes clear that a US response of some kind is now unavoidable. Former President Donald Trump has proclaimed on social media that “we are on the brink of World War III.”While that assessment is a tad exaggerated, a search of Bloomberg News Trends, which counts all news stories appearing on the terminal including from third-party sources, suggests that it has some currency. Stories about World War III are their highest in 16 months. Outside of the heated presidential campaign of 2016, the Ukraine invasion, and  the assassination of Iranian military commander Qassim Soleimani in January 2020, talk of another global conflagration is at its highest in a decade:\nScary stuff. And yet, as Isabelle Lee recounts below, US stock markets rallied to end the day at another all-time high. There were reasons that we’ll come to, and markets have shrugged off other Third World War scares in recent years. But the fact remains that it’s unwise to buy up equities in this way if you think there’s a chance of an imminent apocalypse. So why the comfort level?Part of the issue is the gradual desensitization to bad news that means each fresh shock needs to be greater than the preceding one to have the same impact. After a series of atrocities, they begin to lose their ability to shake us. The last few years have had enough geopolitical surprises that arrived completely out of left field that this latest event doesn’t add to the fear in trading rooms.Further, suggests Tina Fordham of Fordham Global Foresight, traders’ calm can be attributed to a reading of US politics and the incentives facing President Joe Biden. “The average trader tends to rely on things like, ‘The US wouldn’t go into a war in an election year.’ But is this time different? And why?”With Republicans led by Donald Trump goading him into action, Biden has no choice but to retaliate. As he tries to fight both Iran and Trump, it grows hard to see exactly who is Dr. Strangelove in this scenario. The task is to find a retaliation that shows strength without further expanding the conflict. “The US has to retaliate. It has to go up a level,” says Fordham. “But I bet that if the US only retaliates on targets inside Iraq, I don’t think the markets would blink.”\n    George C. Scott as Gen. Buck Turgidson, before promotion to “Patton.” Photographer: Columbia Pictures/Moviepix via Getty Images\nFinding the precise measured response to convey strength and deter Iran without provoking more escalation is not going to be easy. (See:  War Room absurdity in Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.) The decision will rest on the shoulders of Biden himself, even if the entire US government apparatus is there to advise him. Calibrating it just wrong could provoke disaster. But for markets, the question concerning the Middle East is always whether it will push up the oil price. Another reason for calm in Wall Street is that its traders sub-contract the job of risk assessment to the oil market. If the oil price doesn't spike, then the risk can’t be that great, so it’s safe to stay on the stocks bandwagon. And this is how the spot price of Brent crude has moved so far this year, as a series of events have broadened the conflict:\nOil swiftly fell once trading resumed after the weekend’s news, reassuring traders in other markets that the risks weren’t severe. They are also, arguably, skewed against disaster. If Biden’s response isn’t strong enough, then the US will look bad but the oil will keep flowing. Jean Ergas, chief economist of Tigress Financial Partners in New York, points out that oil is almost a binary market, and that the biggest supertankers don't go through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal in any case. “Either the oil is there or it isn’t. As it is, it’s dangerous, it’s risky, but it’s on its way.” He adds that more signs of a China slowdown (implying reduced oil demand), and strong production from non-OPEC countries also helped keep the crude price down. The effects of shipping delays on the oil price could be significant, but not on the scale to drive another inflationary spiral. If the conflict were to expand to Iranian territory and stop significant amounts of oil production (possible but still not the most likely scenario at present), then the situation grows much more severe. That is the risk to monitor, and the oil price suggests it’s still not that great. However, concentrating on oil may not capture the dangers to inflation. This is how the price of Shanghai containerized shipping (including routes through both the Panama and Suez canals) has moved recently. Questions over both choke points for global shipping have had their effect:\nTom Holland of Gavekal Economics estimates the costs of rerouting around Africa for those tankers that could have used the Red Sea as adding at least 6,000 kilometers and 10 days to voyages. With daily charter costs for tankers doubling in the last six months, he thinks that this should add “more than $1 to the cost of each barrel of oil, on top of the heightened general risk premium.” That is less than catastrophic, but threatens to raise prices even without further major escalation. Another risk comes from the fog of war. Attacks on Houthi infrastructure impede their ability to launch well-targeted attacks. That might add to the case for ships to head for the tip of Africa. According to Holland:Until recently, Yemen’s Houthis have said they will not target Russian (or Chinese) shipping. But the more the Houthi targeting ability is degraded by US air strikes, the greater the risk of indiscriminate attacks against neutral vessels, and the bigger the incentive for shippers to reroute vessels to avoid the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.This affects monetary policy by creating another inflation supply shock, even if a broad all-out war is avoided. Ed Yardeni suggests even that the risks of major delays “also increases the risks of a second bout of inflation similar to what happened during the two energy crises in the 1970s.” That is never a comfortable comparison. Now to look at what else drove markets on a day of bleak news. \n      Everything Apart From World War III...\nPossibly the most consequential week of this earnings season is underway. Five megacaps with a combined market value of more than $10 trillion are slated to report. Between Tuesday and Thursday, they include Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.. For the full week, 108 S&P 500 companies — around 39% of the benchmark’s market cap — report.“Technology companies may determine success or failure for the S&P 500 earnings season as well as index earnings in 2024,” wrote Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gina Martin Adams and Gillian Wolff.As it stands, Wall Street expects roughly 16% year-over-year earnings growth from the sector. Only six months ago, it was braced for an outright contraction of 2%. This is almost a mirror image of expectations for the rest of the S&P — analysts now expect a 2% contraction, down from expectations of nearly 6% growth just three months ago. So a lot is resting on tech;  it would be nice if the consensus were right. As it stands, the big tech groups are regarded almost as a bulwark against Middle Eastern conflagration.It’s the consensus for a reason. Megacap tech shares have driven most of the gains of the market. Data from Deutsche Bank Research show that positioning in tech is the only one notably above historical average, at the 73rd percentile.\nInflows into tech ETFs and mutual funds, which were already strong, accelerated to the highest in five months at $2.8 billion. Over the last 12 months, the sector has swamped all others to a remarkable extent:\nThe leviathans’ earnings announcements will be interrupted in midweek by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. It would be astonishing if the central bank did not hold rates steady on Wednesday afternoon, but much depends on Chair Jerome Powell’s willingness to trail a rate cut for the next meeting in March. “The Fed will try to douse hopes of any early easing in policy,” wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This is, in part, because they are genuinely uncertain about how sticky inflation might be in an economy experiencing above trend economic growth and a still very tight labor market.” Optimism about an economic soft landing has pushed stocks to price in an “immaculate everything” scenario, said Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research, in which “the Fed cuts deeply and the US economy (at worst) glides down… While we’re still not believers, our sense is that the Fed and economy are now ‘show me’ stories.” Monday’s key development came at 3 p.m., when the Treasury made its  quarterly refunding announcement and the market dodged another bullet. With federal debt at historically high levels, the minutiae of how much the government borrows and on what terms grow far more important. Senyek had suggested that the greatest risk of a “definitive downside catalyst” could have been an announcement of increased borrowing. Instead, borrowing for this quarter will be lower than previously advised, and then much lower in the second quarter. At least for one day’s trading, that proved to be a definitive up-side catalyst:\nPossibly even more important will be the announcement Wednesday, before US markets open, of how the Treasury intends to apportion its borrowing. It decided earlier this year to raise far more from short-term bills than usual; whether that continues, and the size of the auctions Uncle Sam wants the market to swallow, remain hugely important questions. If we look at how stocks and bonds have done (in the customary 60/40 portfolio) over the last 12 months, we can see that the last two quarterly refunding announcements both marked big turning points. The need to raise more funding scared the markets in August, and the measures to cushion the blow announced in November were critical to the end-of-year rally that followed:\nAfter the Treasury and the Fed, nobody can slope off for a long weekend. The usual raft of first-day-of-the-month economic numbers from around the world is due on Thursday, followed by Payrolls Friday.

        "content": "        Victory is at hand for the Federal Reserve, and yet the pressure is ratcheting up. Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, the\n      Powell  Under Pressure\nVictory is at hand for the Federal Reserve, and yet the pressure is ratcheting up. Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, the latest printout of the personal consumption expenditure deflator, the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, continued its unmistakable decline. The core metric, excluding food and fuel, has dipped just below 3%. The statistical purists’ “trimmed mean” PCE inflation (excluding the biggest outliers in both directions and taking the average of the rest) also suggests ongoing improvement, particularly over the last six months:\nSo inflation presents ever less of an obstacle to cutting rates, if the central bank wants to do that. The question is whether there is any pressing need to do so, as the economy appears to be humming along beautifully with rates where they are. One argument for cutting, given some extra fuel by a Wall Street Journal analysis over the weekend, is that falling inflation automatically raises real rates (the amount by which rates exceed inflation). This, many would say, is the key measure of how tight financial conditions truly are, and would tend to suggest that rates already look excessive. Definitional issues now raise their ugly head.  At the committee’s meeting last May, Chair Jerome Powell introduced his preferred definition, which subtracts the one-year bond market breakeven rate of inflation from the effective fed funds rates. At the time, that made real rates look far higher than they did using most other logical alternative measures, so it looked as though he might be establishing a rationale for cuts. That is even more the case now. Subtract current core CPI inflation from fed funds, or take the yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and real rates look considerably less alarming: \nIn this context, it’s interesting that the WSJ chose to graph real rates using the Powell definition. Is it as concerning a measure as it looks? Arguably not. Taking the broad measures of financial conditions published by Goldman Sachs and by Bloomberg ourselves, which include risk appetite from the stock market, bonds, and commodities, we find they are in agreement that life in the financial space at present is distinctly easy. According to Bloomberg’s version, they’re almost as lenient as they were for much of 2021 while inflation was growing out of hand. Goldman doesn’t go that far, but also shows that conditions are easier than the norm:\nLooking at volatility measures, based on how much investors are spending in derivatives to guard against future major price moves, the most popular metrics give a clear steer. Compared to the beginning of January 2022, when the rise in rates got underway, the CBOE VIX index is actually some 20% lower. High overnight rates are causing no stress to speak of in the stock market. The MOVE index of bond volatility is only 20% above January 2022, despite all the uncertainty surrounding the bond market. It has fallen very significantly since the brief crisis for regional banks in March last year. If high real rates are worrying investors about the future for asset prices, they are not showing it, at all:\nOn the face of it, this is evidence that it would be dangerous to cut, however we choose to measure real rates. As   Lu Wang points out for Bloomberg, rising stock markets create wealth that can be spent, thus fueling inflation. Low volatility suggests an environment in which sentiment is calm and investors are comfortable taking risks. That implies that there should be no urgency at all to cut the fed funds rate. Asset price inflation would increase the risk of broader price rises.Against this, other ways to calculate conditions portray a different picture. The yield curve is deeply inverted, meaning that shorter-term yields continue to be lower than long-term yields. While the gap has narrowed considerably, the inversion persists. This makes life difficult for banks whose business is based around borrowing short-term through deposits and lending long-term. The following chart compiled by Will Denyer of Gavekal Research smooshes together measures that more directly capture how expensive it is to get things done — such as the gap between the return on invested capital and the weighted average cost of that capital, housing affordability, and growth in the money supply. This exercise showed extreme tight conditions early last year. It still suggests that things are roughly as restrictive as on the verge of the Global Financial Crisis. So on this basis, there’s an argument the FOMC could use to justify a cut this week: \nOne final data point from this month’s updates suggests that however real rates should be measured, the rates that companies currently have to pay aren’t hurting them anything like as much as inflation. The National Federation of Independent Business’s monthly survey of small business executives has been asking for decades what the greatest problem of the moment is. The percentage naming rates and financing has ticked up to its highest in more than a decade — at just under 5%. Far more executives remain most worried by price rises.\nThis survey has provided good “soft data” over the years, and tends to argue that there’s no urgency to cut rates. And that brings us to another issue. \n      Soft Data, Hard Data and Political Polls\nThe Fed generally takes seriously such soft data from surveys, as  Patrick Harker, head of the Philadelphia Fed, explained earlier this month. It’s particularly anxious to do so now, because the official hard data emphatically suggest that the economy is much healthier than the one described in soft surveys. Many Americans plainly think that the economy is still terrible, despite  the administration’s claims to the contrary, while political polls show deep disapproval of current economic policy.But this raises the problem of political bias, which has intensified with American polarization in recent years. Some of the people who answer political opinion polls will also answer soft economic surveys. All are human and susceptible to allowing prior opinions to color their perceptions.The NFIB survey is (rightly) regarded as prone to conservative bias, as small business executives tend not to be liberal Democrats. It’s possible that they’re sufficiently influenced by Republican messaging, which hammers away at inflation and President Joe Biden’s responsibility for it, that leads them to name inflation as their greatest worry. Without the political framing, maybe they would start to be more concerned about high interest rates. It’s at least plausible that this effect is at work. However, it’s a remarkably strong one if it’s really concealing an urgent need from small businesses for lower rates, given how emphatic the results are at present. It would be unwise to dismiss this as all the result of polarized politics. Meanwhile, inflation expectations reported to researchers at the University of Michigan, probably the most closely followed sentiment survey, show an obvious political gap. On inflation expectations over the next five years, a vitally important variable for the Fed, Republicans have been braced for far steeper price rises than Democrats or Independents throughout the current inflation scare — but it’s encouraging that the parties are beginning to converge, with Independents now expecting slightly higher rises than Republicans. That might be because Republicans are confident that one of their own will be in the White House for most of the next five years:\nBut when UMich researchers moved to sentiment about current economic conditions, the gap could be a Grand Canyon visible from space. For Democrats, things are now back to where they were before the pandemic, and have improved dramatically over the last 18 months. For Republicans, the economy has barely even started to recover, and remains far, far weaker than in 2019. (For reasons that must make sense to the graphic software, the white and gray lines representing Republicans and Independents are flipped around in these two charts. Apologies for the confusion.)\nInequality might explain some of this. American party politics has turned so far inside out over the last generation that self-identified Republicans tend to be poorer, and report that they are living in a tougher economy. Democrats might tend to be in professions that were better isolated from the pandemic. But the breadth and persistence of the divide make clear that political framing has much to do with it. Democrats are probably overstating their comfort with the economy, while Republicans are exaggerating the problems. Democratic strategists might be well-advised to focus on the line for Independents, who perceive the economy to be in only slightly better shape than in the months of tightest pandemic lockdowns in 2020. That suggests the Vibecession is still around despite some signs (as covered by  Paul Krugman in the New York Times) that it’s lifting. There are plenty of explanations out there for why the economy evidently feels worse to fair-minded people than it should according to all the hard data. As   Craig Torres explains for Bloomberg, the problem for many Americans is that price levels remain higher than they were three years ago, even if inflation has slowed down.Would such people rejoice at a fall in interest rates, or instead interpret it as a sign that the powers that be were ignoring the problems that higher prices were causing for them? And even more pertinently, should central bankers pay heed to the obvious discontent that must spring from something tangible — or should they ignore data that is so plainly at odds with cold, hard facts? \n      "

Now the question is whether central banks will valorize that market optimis\n  The Tide Is High\nThe tide of inflation has turned. So have rates in bond markets. Now the question is whether central banks will valorize that market optimism on rates. Politics makes that question even more fraught than it needs to be, and it’s fair to expect that throughout the 10 months we all have to survive until to the US presidential elections. Ostensibly, the download of the government’s first estimate of gross domestic product in the final quarter of last year should support those who think inflation has been beaten. For the second quarter in succession, core prices rose at an annualized rate of exactly 2%, which happens to be the Federal Reserve’s  target:\nThe problem, if it can be called that, is that the economy appears to be in rude health. The figures are often revised, but an annualized growth rate of 3.3%, at a time when many were braced for a recession to be well underway, makes clear that growth is surprisingly good. If we look at Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index, a gauge of how incoming data compares to prior expectations, we find that it’s jumped back into positive territory this month, after very briefly turning slightly negative:\nRate cuts are generally a measure to be used when things are going wrong. These are not the numbers that would be produced by an economy  desperately in need of a rate cut. So while the data begin to look as though it would be safe for the Fed to start cutting soon, they also suggest zero urgency. Barring major data surprises in either direction, this is likely still to be true when the Federal Open Markets Committee meets in March. Expect the next few weeks to be consumed by debate over how the Fed should approach this decision — more scared of cutting too soon, or cutting too late? And how can or should politics affect their call?The Fed’s Reaction FunctionWhat is the worst that could happen? An increasing volume of critics is complaining that the Fed is risk-averse and sees cutting as inherently more dangerous than standing pat. Opinion colleague Claudia Sahm points out that several members of the FOMC have said that their priority is to avoid cutting only then to have to reverse course. This is from committee member and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic:We do not want to go on these up-and-down or a back-and-forth pattern. I want us to be absolutely certain that inflation is where we need it to be before we move too dramatically.Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed said that March would be “probably too early in my estimate for a rate decline because I think we need to see some more evidence.” In all cases, Sahm argues that the Fed should regard allowing an unnecessary recession or hard landing as a far worse outcome than a reversed rate cut in the event inflation picked up. Unlike most other central banks, the Fed has a remit to care about the economy as well as prices, which should lower the bar for cutting. Former colleague  Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times argues: The honest thing to say — if you really want to keep interest rates high — would be that the job is done but could come undone, so it’s better to keep rates high out of an abundance of caution. The reason to do this, but not to say it, is surely that it’s hard to defend in public — and central bankers’ fear of having to reverse course. That may be a sensible plan to avoid losing face. But it’s not an encouraging basis for public policy.Martin’s case is fair, but overcoming the abundance of caution requires addressing the potent lesson from the worst central banking experience in modern history, as well as countering one of the strongest instincts in human nature. The SeventiesThe Fed has never lost control of prices quite like in the 1970s. Inflation peaked, relented as the central bank under Arthur Burns cut rates, then took off for an even worse spike at the end of the decade. In 1980, even Paul Volcker, who would go on to earn his reputation as the man who vanquished inflation, cut rates too soon and had to reverse course. Arguably, the recession he created wouldn’t have been so bad without the need to correct the message from his early cut. The lesson for their heirs: Don’t, whatever you do, cut rates too soon. The world has changed in the last 50 years. The causes of this inflation, driven initially by the sudden stop of the pandemic and the supply disruptions that followed, are different. But if you put headline inflation since the end of 2018 next to 1971, you can see why a Fed governor would be nervous about cutting rates until totally, absolutely sure that it’s safe:\nYes, this inflationary incident is very different from the 1970s. That history could mislead us onto the wrong policy path now. Still, the desire not to be the next Arthur Burns must be potent.Loss AversionMore fundamentally, there is the issue of  loss aversion. It’s deeply embedded in us that we don’t like it if you fail to lead us into a gain; but we  absolutely passionately hate you when you cause us a loss. For pundits like me, that creates asymmetric incentives. It’s far more embarrassing to get a bullish call wrong (and cause people to lose money), than to make a bad bearish call (and cause them to miss out on a gain). I failed to tell people to fill their boots with Bitcoin 10 years ago, which is a shame. But I am so, so glad that I never told them to pile into Enron or Worldcom, or make a big bet on Chinese stocks.Central bankers face the same issue. They don’t want to overdo hikes and bring the economy to a halt; that will make them unpopular. But the punishment for the opposite error, of cutting too fast and letting inflation take off, is much worse. The most notorious monetary policy failures tend to be rate cuts, or refusal to hike. Times when central banks were too hawkish tend not to linger so long in the memory. Further, caution is regarded as the prime virtue in central bankers. Ben Bernanke’s record is very defensible, but his  best-known quote by far is his comment in the summer of 2007 that the “vast majority of mortgages, including even subprime mortgages, continue to perform well.” You can understand central-bankerly reluctance to proclaim the all-clear.PoliticsA final problem concerns politics and the way it affects both the Fed’s potential decisions and the data on which they’ll be based. There’s a widespread belief in markets that the FOMC will want to do all it can to avert a Trump victory in November, and therefore cut rates sooner than otherwise. Whether or not this is true, it does make it harder to cut; Donald Trump would doubtless call foul, and heap derision on Jerome Powell and his colleagues. It’s only human that they’d want to avoid that. Politics complicates the decision and makes it much harder to predict.\n   How the Mighty Fall\nIt was another tumultuous trading session Thursday for Tesla Inc. after the electric-vehicle maker warned that its rate of expansion this year will be “notably lower.” Its shares slumped as much as 12% to their biggest one-day drop in a year, translating to an $80 billion wipeout. Compared to the market, that’s Tesla’s worst  day since the pandemic:\nWhether it’s that the company declined to offer specific targets for the year ahead, or that it fell well short of the 50% annual growth that management guided to in the past despite slashing prices throughout 2023, Elon Musk’s pitch for investors to look past slower sales growth — adding that this blip is temporary — simply did not work. “We can quibble about the specifics… but the biggest problem is the bigger picture. Tesla has always been about the future,” wrote Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers. “That is why it is particularly distressing that the company was either unable or unwilling to offer any specifics about Tesla’s near future.”\nTesla’s P/E of 70 suggests it is “priced for perfection,” Sosnick said, and yet the earnings call radiated anything but that. “Tesla has always ‘sold the sizzle,’ and then it actually delivered the steak. The problem for the company is that investors now expect a big fat T-bone and are disappointed when they only hear a sizzling platter from across the way.”  They’re now far more excited about artificial intelligence, embodied by Nvidia Corp., than electric vehicles:\nCompounding the lackluster results was Musk’s demand of a 25% ownership stake from the board via new stock grants or new share classes, said Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates Inc. “The fact that Elon Musk may become less involved with Tesla is also overhanging the stock and clouding its outlook.” Investors have given the company quite a pass for its dreadful corporate governance for many years, but this might be evidence that Musk cannot take things any further without damaging the share  price.Tesla is now barely hanging on as the 10th largest stock in the S&P 500. It’s dropped two places already this year, being overtaken by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Broadcom Inc. On Thursday, it looks like Eli Lilly & Co. also briefly overtook the carmaker in market value, spurred by hope for its anti-obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The jump made Lilly the world’s largest health-care company with a valuation of just above $595 billion compared to Tesla’s roughly $580 billion.\nTesla’s slump to the bottom of the top 10 is one thing; Lilly overtaking it is another. Colleague Angel Adegbesan says it “signals a shift in investor appetite. No longer are EV makers and suppliers bought on the promise of mass uptake. Instead, all things weight-loss have come into favor.”It’s possible that weight-loss is the next fad. It’s also noticeable that Tesla’s loss of magnificence hasn’t stopped US indexes from logging more all-time highs. Examining the giants of technology and treating them as separate entities is a consummation devoutly to be wished. We should get more evidence next week, when Microsoft Corp. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. are slated to report on Tuesday to be followed later by Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. —Isabelle Lee\n      "

A fall in y\n      Chips With Everything\nThe US stock market is behaving like a perpetual motion machine. Bond yields rose Wednesday, as they have for most of this year. A fall in yields triggered last year’s stocks rally — now higher rates are allowing the market to go further. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 notched gains for the fifth straight day, while the benchmark S&P 500 managed to scale its fourth record in a week.The semiconductor sector, led by Nvidia Corp., is in the vanguard, helped by a surprising geopolitical gift. After great apprehension ahead of Taiwan’s election, which installed a president who favors independence from China, the result was greeted with calm, and appears to have left the status quo intact. Given the island’s importance for chip manufacturing, that had quite an impact on share prices, whether in the US Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index (SOX), Europe’s ASML Holding NV, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.: \nBut the rally is about far more than dodging a bullet in the South China Sea. The unbridled optimism is grounded in the promise of artificial intelligence that caught fire with the arrival of the ChatGPT app in November 2022. That rationale has lost its novelty now, but it’s still bringing the market to levels that have caught even the greatest optimists off guard.Just 25 days into 2024, the S&P 500 has already blown past the Wall Street consensus target for its performance for the end of this year. Among the 20 strategist estimates compiled by my colleague Lu Wang, the benchmark gauge — which closed Wednesday at 4,868 — now sits above the average of 4,867. To be sure, the index hasn’t breached the 5,200 top end of the range yet, but the pace has surprised more or less everyone.\nWall Street veteran Ed Yardeni has a year-end forecast of 5,400, well ahead of Wednesday’s close, but the speed of the advance is what is concerning him. “The S&P 500 may be starting a tech-led melt-up similar to what happened during the second half of the 1990s,” Yardeni wrote in a note. “We are wondering whether a bout of irrational exuberance might push the multiple higher, inflating a speculative bubble in the stock market as occurred during the late 1990s.” The parallels between the speed of this rally and the definitive melt-up that lasted from 1998 to early 2000 are eerily close. It’s easiest to compare Nvidia, by far thought most likely to benefit the most from the new technology, to Cisco Systems Inc. back then. The company that dominated the production of the routers necessary for the internet to function was, like Nvidia today, already well-established and not a start-up yet to make a profit like many dot-coms. Another more direct comparison would be Intel Corp., then the dominant maker of chips. Handily, the earlier melt-up dated from a surprise pivot by the Federal Reserve in October 1998, and the current one got going on almost exactly the same day of 2022 — after a surprise pivot by the Fed. Here is how Cisco’s and Intel’s performance to their peak in March 2000 compares to Nvidia’s rise to date:\nSo it’s not so irresponsible to make comparisons. Price action matters because it can reveal whether the market has reached what John Maynard Keynes called the speculative stage, when investors are buying merely because they believe they can soon sell for more, and not because of any judgment about fundamentals. And by some measures, it looks like we’re there. Compare on the basis of valuations and, once more, the parallels are uncomfortably close. This is the same exercise, this time showing the price/sales ratio of Cisco and Intel back in the day, and Nvidia today:\nNvidia is seen just as exciting a prospect as Cisco. That is concerning because after Cisco’s peak in 2000, the share price fell 89%, and it was not until late 2021 that it got back to the old high. Cisco’s stock currently trades about 5% below its peak from March 2000 — even though it has largely fulfilled the rosy expectations, continuing to be a leading manufacturer of the infrastructure for an internet that has transformed the world in the last 25 years. Unfortunately, the arrival of a new and transformative technology is one of the classic pre-conditions for a bubble. Most of history’s great speculative excesses weren’t stupid. They were based on genuinely exciting developments. The problem is that it’s very hard to value the future growth of new innovations, and people will leap in to make a fast buck. There were booms and busts surrounding the arrival of canals, railroads, the motor car and the internet. All proved transformative, but created a great opportunity to lose money in the short term. The conditions are also there in AI.In another sign, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday briefly achieved a historic $3 trillion valuation again largely thanks to optimism over artificial intelligence. Many view Microsoft as one of the biggest potential AI beneficiaries due to its partnership with OpenAI Inc., which produced ChatGPT. “We understand that companies like Apple and Google and Meta are working on ways to monetize generative AI, but you have to admit that Microsoft right now really is the only working model where you can engage with ChatGPT for a subscription,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told my colleague Ryan Vlastelica.Microsoft briefly surpassed Apple Inc. — which last year became the first company to hit $3 trillion. By the close, Tim Cook’s Apple had regained its crown as the world’s most valuable public company. Microsoft and Apple are both part of the Magnificent Seven cohort of internet platform groups that have surged this month. The two alone account for more than 14% of the S&P 500. All that said, valuations are quite tame compared to the dot-com era even if the Magnificent Seven trades at 41 times profit compared to 15 times for the average stock in the S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index. As colleagues Wang and Alexandra Semenova point out, there is an argument that equities look less extended than they did during the meme stock excitement three years ago, or at the prior top for the overall market in early 2022. At that time, the Nasdaq 100’s P/E was about 4 points higher than now. And the diaspora of no-hope start-ups is not around.Even expectations for the Magnificent Seven, while still promising, have tempered a little. Emily Roland of John Hancock Investment Management believes the exuberance will soon fade. “It’s like dry January, right? The excitement is kind of gone at this point and everybody’s kind of sobering up a little bit after the pivot party.”Tesla Inc., one of the hottest stocks in existence, inadvertently showed that market enthusiasm is growing more reasonable when it announced thoroughly disappointing earnings, and lower projections for production this year. Tesla “only” dropped 6% in the after-market, which was more restrained than the declines that greeted its earnings in the three previous quarters. That suggests that the excitement isn’t untamable. But it’s always as well to take care when markets move this fast. — Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      About That Pivot...\nThe original catalyst for all this excitement, remember, was the Fed’s pivot toward lower rates, which Chair Jerome Powell made explicit. We will hear from the Federal Open Market Committee next week, when it has the opportunity to set up a first rate cut for March. Market expectations still imply a 50-50 chance that it will come that early. However, futures bets have been scaled back, and bond yields have risen, as investors try to correct for what might have been an over-enthusiastic reaction to the Fed pivot. Other central banks are setting the scene.On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada left rates on hold, as expected, but dropped a very strong hint that it was shifting toward cuts by removing a sentence from prior statements that said it remained prepared to hike again. Thursday morning brings the European Central Bank, which is  generally expected to start easing this year, but a little after the Fed. It’s been troubled by both higher inflation and worse unemployment than in the US, making its judgment difficult. But the market is growing in confidence that rates will eventually come down significantly, as shown by the latest Bank of America fund manager survey:\nThe latest flash purchasing manager indexes, summarized below by Capital  Economics, show continuing deceleration for France and Germany, although not for the euro zone as a whole. The ECB appears to have a stronger incentive to cut just to avert a major slowdown:\nAs far as the market is concerned, the inflation scare is more or less over, removing another reason for hawkishness. The 10-year breakeven rate in Germany, the bond market’s implicit estimate of average inflation over the next 10 years, is almost exactly at the ECB’s target of 2%. Expectations were briefly sent out of control by the energy crisis that accompanied Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That is now over:\nMeanwhile, the Fed has a new data point that might help it to cut earlier. Many complain that rents in the official inflation data are out of date, because they are based on the average of all contracts in force, not on those taken out in the last month. The Cleveland Fed produces a quarterly index of moves in rents for new tenants, however, and in the last quarter of 2023 it showed a year-on-year drop of 5%, the biggest fall since the index was started. That implies the Fed can start cutting even if the official inflation number is above target:\nThe FOMC will also have cover for easing from a report called  Is The Last Mile More Arduous?, produced earlier this month by the Atlanta Fed’s research department, which has already generated much discussion. It suggested that there was no particular reason that the last decline in inflation before getting back to target should require any more aggressive measures than earlier in the cycle. The conclusion was emphatic:With inflation approaching its target—albeit in a bumpy fashion—and with relatively strong growth in employment and real GDP, it does not seem prudent to tighten policy due to concerns about the last mile being more arduous. Such tightening would needlessly increase the risk of a hard landing for the economy.Such arguments from the business sector are common; this one comes from within the Fed itself. Even with yields rising, the pressure on central banks to ease is growing, and the case for them to do so is also falling into place, if they want to use it. Now to wait for the ECB. \n      "

Shortly after reports broke that Chinese authorities are considering a bold plan to arrest a stock market rout by seeking to mobilize about $278 billion to prop it up, mainly from the offshore accounts of state-owned enterprises, investors were left unsatisfied — and with yet more questions.The move came as the benchmark CSI 300 index plummeted to a five-year low this week, with Chinese and Hong Kong stocks in aggregate erasing more than $6 trillion in market value since their peak in 2021. That’s roughly equivalent to the entire market capitalization of Japan.\nIt only added to the gloom for an already morose set of traders still reeling from the protracted property downturn and the grim state of China’s economy. Money to stop the selloff is all very well, but they’ll want to know what the government would do next. “The potential support package should be able to stem declines in the short term and stabilize markets into the Lunar New Year,” said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But state buying alone has historically had limited success in turning around market sentiment if not followed up by further measures.”The order from Premier Li Qiang, meant to calm investors, seems to have done the opposite. China’s history of botched market rescue efforts contributed to that, fueled by uncertainties over Beijing’s long-term policy roadmap. For a metric of how much shares have slumped, consider this: The value of China’s equity market has never been this far behind the US. The key challenge for stocks “is the poor macroeconomic climate and investors’ skepticism as to Beijing’s commitment to investor-friendly policies, where there is no quick fix,” Michael Hirson of 22V Research wrote. “Beijing will step up stimulus in coming months, though I remain skeptical that it will be of the scale or the nature to quickly break out of the dynamics above.”A bright spot is Alibaba Group Holding. Its US-listed shares jumped after the New York Times reported that Jack Ma has been buying stock in the company he founded. Alibaba’s 7.9% gain — its best day since July — came after a 38% decline over the past year, which mirrors broader declines in China’s equities. The blunt-spoken Ma, who adopted a far lower profile after Beijing clamped down in 2020, reportedly bought $50 million worth of stock in the quarter. Alibaba Chairman Joseph Tsai has also been snapping up shares at a much larger scale. His Blue Pool Management family investment vehicle purchased almost 2 million of Alibaba’s US-traded shares in the fourth quarter, worth about $152 million.That aside, skepticism remains. What’s perhaps most alarming is that while the loss of confidence is palpable — despite continued growth of more than 5% in China’s gross domestic product last year — it’s nowhere near so clear exactly what has undermined it. One view attributes this to Beijing’s attempt to rein in the financial sector, fulfilling a longstanding preoccupation to avert a potential Minsky Moment. Putting serious money into the stock market will tend to vitiate this effort by funding more financial speculation. “We reiterate our August view that investors should refrain from bottom fishing Chinese risk assets,” Marko Papic, chief strategist at the Clocktower Group. “We stick to the view that a significant stimulus effort is inherently incompatible with Beijing’s aspiration to curb the financial sector in the coming years.”Bloomberg Opinion colleague Shuli Ren suggests that the plunge in sentiment stems from alarm that the government won’t in fact have the guts to head off a financial crisis. The latest selloff has come despite a surprisingly calm response to the Taiwan election; this was possibly negated by Donald Trump’s return to the headlines, with his anti-Chinese rhetoric. Meanwhile, a longstanding tight relationship with the stock markets of the rest of the emerging world appears to have been sundered. Throughout China’s long expansion since joining the World Trade Organization, the rest of EM has been treated by investors as wholly dependent on Chinese growth. MSCI’s indexes for the other emerging markets have tracked China’s almost perfectly for 20 years — but now the bet is that other EMs can prosper whatever happens in Beijing and Shanghai:\nCould the rest of the emerging world conceivably continue to flourish if China’s corporate sector crashes in the way the market now seems to expect? It’s at least worth asking the question. A lot of optimism about a range of countries that have spent two decades growing by serving China’s insatiable appetite seems to be embedded in current assumptions. Which brings us to New Delhi…\n      Arise India\nIndia is having a moment. Its stock market capitalization has just overtaken Hong Kong’s for the first time. The combined value of shares listed on Indian exchanges reached $4.33 trillion as of Monday’s close, versus $4.29 trillion for Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The first time the South Asian nation breached the $4 trillion threshold was on Dec. 5, and about half of that has come in just the past four years:\nThere are reasons for this. Bloomberg colleague Ashutosh Joshi explains:Equities in India have been booming, thanks to a rapidly growing retail investor base and strong corporate earnings. The world’s most populous country has positioned itself as an alternative to China, attracting fresh capital from global investors and companies alike, thanks to its stable political setup and a consumption-driven economy that remains among the fastest-growing of major nations.Indian economic ambitions are stirring further excitement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks of arriving as a “developed nation” by the centenary of independence in 2047. To bulls, there is no stopping India from notching an even higher ranking. Shilan Shah of Capital Economics believes the country can become the world’s third-largest economy within the next decade. He does warn, however, that emergence of generative artificial intelligence could well hamper India’s rise by reducing western demand for its business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. “The emergence of AI could knock about 0.3% points off annual productivity growth over the next 10 or so years,” wrote Shah, the firm’s deputy chief emerging markets economist. But that needn’t lead to the “complete disappearance” of India’s BPO sector. “And neither will it preclude relatively strong rates of economic growth over the coming years. After all, India will still benefit from a positive demographic outlook, as well as productivity gains from friend-shoring as the global economy continues to fragment.”Another voice of relative caution comes from Alexandra Hermann of Oxford Economics, who made this measured assessment: The economy looks likely to achieve the highest growth rate out of all the major economies and reach upper-middle income status over the next decade. But becoming a high-income country is a tougher target, requiring per capita GDP rising to around US$14,000 from under US$2,500 currently. Achieving this target by 2047… [would be] highly ambitious both by historical standards and our forecasts.Oxford Economics illustrates this here:\nIn short, Modi is setting out to beat the “middle-income trap” that has ensnared most other developing nations. That’s a big ask. While the necessary conditions for growth are in place, with strengthening corporate balance sheets and returning foreign investment, Hermann cautions that “structural barriers to greater investment remain.” In particular, she reports that many Indian investors had “acute” concern “with regards to the size of India's bureaucracy, especially when it comes to land and labor regulations and the pace of reform implementation.”A final issue is the difference between the economy and the stock market. Valuation gives some cause for skepticism. Using cyclically adjusted price/earnings multiples, Barclays data show that Chinese stocks for several years traded exactly in line with the US — a fact that with hindsight suggests remarkable overconfidence in China’s corporate governance and in the intentions of the ruling Communist Party.  \nThere are lots of great things about India. In the long run, it should be a safe bet to log faster economic growth than the US. But should the Indian stock market really be trading at the same multiple as America’s, which is loaded with the world’s most powerful and well-entrenched tech companies? That is a reach. In hindsight, it wasn’t such a great idea to extrapolate Chinese growth into the future in a straight line, and assume that equity market capitalization could match it. The risk is that the money surging out of China will redirect itself on equally shaky grounds. There are opportunities in India, but they should be selected with care. \n      "

        "content": "        “Like anybody, I would like to live a long life — longevity has its place,” said Martin Luther King Jr. in the last speech he would ever giv\n      ongevity\n“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life — longevity has its place,” said Martin Luther King Jr. in the last speech he would ever give. “But I'm not concerned about that now.” That was one of history’s greatest and most prophetic orations. In the 56 years since, humanity has moved on. People still want to live a longer life, they are increasingly having their wish, and they’re able to deploy money to make it happen. But while longevity continues to lengthen, day-to-day most people don’t seem so concerned about it.In the financial world, at least, that is shifting. Longevity is a  full-fledged investment theme, with  ambitious tech entrepreneurs even shifting from trying to increase longevity to making at attempt to  conquer mortality itself. There is also ever more awkward stirring over the impact that a population that lives longer, in combination with a falling birth rate, could have on the economy.By definition, demographics only change very slowly, making their effects easy to ignore. Wars and increasingly ugly politics make it all the harder to pay attention. But the Covid-19 pandemic aroused fears that the birth rate could decline even faster. The numbers being published for 2023 begin to suggest those fears were reasonable. James Pomeroy, global economist at HSBC Plc, said:Here comes the drop… We have been warning that birth rates could move to much lower levels in the coming years — with economic concerns, social changes and a pandemic hangover pushing more people away from larger families or having children at all. In recent years, it looks like a lot of these issues have come together — with birth rates falling sharply across the world.And indeed, the decline in birth rates is strikingly broad, although it does vary greatly by geography. These figures are from HSBC:\nThe pandemic shook up priorities. The uncertainty doubtless led many young couples to wait longer to have children. It’s possible that this is yet another Covid-induced blip that will correct itself in time. To use that word yet again, birth rates tumbling at this rate may well be transitory. However, there are reasons to expect a structural decline for a while. As Pomeroy points out, if couples in their 30s can no longer afford to buy a house, and if college fees down the road promise to be prohibitive, it’s only rational to put off starting a family. If people wait longer, the overall birth rate will fall. And it only exacerbates a trend toward starting families late, which began with the mass entry of women into the workforce — a trend that won’t be reversed:\nThanks to its sheer size, and to the legacy of previous  crude but effective attempts to dampen the birth rate, China’s demography tends to dominate perception. As this chart from Ernan Cui of Gavekal Dragonomics demonstrates, Chinese births are falling much faster than recent projections had predicted. Continuing declines in the number of women of child-bearing age will likely bring them down further:\nOther countries have seen sharp falls in births in the past, notably Japan, where births started to decline in 1973. The country began to lapse into its long economic malaise in 2000 as that cohort began to reach parenting age. But as Cui shows, the decline in China since its recent peak in 2016 has been much faster:\n“Demography is destiny” is a maxim attributed (perhaps dubiously) to the French “father of sociology,” Auguste Comte. If global birth rates keep falling at 3% per annum, then the prospects for population growth must be changed radically. Indeed, if HSBC’s calculations are right, the peak in the world’s population is imminent, and the rest of this century will see a decline:\nFew people reading need have any personal concern about the world’s population 76 years from now. And the process of demographic change is so slow that it will have no effect on any market prices this week or next. Governments, however, have to plan ahead; the Philippines is hoping to enrich itself in the next couple of decades before a newly declining birthrate turns into a shortfall of labor (which will impact the rest of the world, as Opinion colleague   Daniel Moss wrote last week). With the pandemic beginning to recede into history, demography is returning to the agenda. As  I wrote about back in 2016, the concern is that an aging population, in conjunction with a lower birth rate, will put greater pressure on finance, leaving governments with a choice between borrowing far more (and raising interest rates), or allowing inflation to deal with the problem. In 2020, in the thick of the pandemic, a book called  The Demographic Reversal, by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, argued that a shrinking and aging population would mean a return to secular inflation. That’s a contentious claim, and in 2021, we hosted a debate with Pradhan on the Bloomberg terminal. You can find  the transcript here.All of us as humans might care about the prospects of a world in which the elderly outnumber those still in work, just as we’d be interested in any technological advances to live a longer, fulfilling life. The financial effects, while obviously profound, are harder to project. But now that the pandemic has persuaded many that secular inflation is back, it would be wise to return to that debate. Pradhan himself suggests that now is a “natural time for everyone to proclaim victory” and bury the  Phillips curve again — but warns that that could be “playing into the hands of a regime change in inflation” in the not-too-distant future. It’s time to pay attention. \n      Deglobalize That\nIt should surprise nobody, but globalization is in decline. That could affect the distribution of wealth in a way that eases pain in certain places, but it likely also means slower growth while reducing the downward pressure on inflation.It’s best not to overstate this. According to the UN Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), foreign direct investment rose a little last year after a terrible 2022, but that was driven entirely by moves between different developed countries that had fallen massively in recent years. FDI into the emerging world, which has grown remarkably consistently over the last three decades, fell back:\nIf globalization was encapsulated by the gradual shift of international flows to fixed investments away from developed nations and into the emerging world, this does look like a potential turning point. Yet again, the pandemic obfuscates everything. And the very specific issues surrounding China plainly drive some of the retreat from emerging market FDI. This is a trend that needs to be watched. \n      Bitcoin ETFs: What Now?\nIt’s been more than a week since ETFs that hold Bitcoin were launched in the US, after a buildup in hype that had lasted years. To date, in aggregate they’ve taken in roughly $1.2 billion in net flows. By many metrics, the launch was a huge success.But to Wall Street strategists, the launch was anything but. Those at JPMorgan Chase & Co. were not impressed. “Consistent with our expectations, we think the initial week of ETF flows have been disappointing,” strategist Kenneth Worthington wrote. “Factually, they have fallen short of expectations for such things as the biggest ETF launch ever.”The team at Citi Research called the amount of money substandard. “Flows into ETFs have disappointed the most optimistic of expectations,” Alex Saunders wrote. “Despite the increase in potential addressable market, we think it will take time for new money to flow in.” They added that volume has declined, as has futures open interest.How to measure this? The most popular parallel is with the birth of the first gold ETF, known as GLD, some 20 years ago. Both gold and Bitcoin — often touted as digital gold — are difficult to trade and to hold. The existence of vehicles like ETFs reduces the friction of purchasing the underlying asset, and should widen the pool of investors. \n    Gold ETF did better in its first week. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\nThe $1.2 billion of inflows from the new batch is, according to JPMorgan, comparable to the launch of the now $56 billion SPDR Gold Shares (ticker GLD), which posted $1.3 billion of inflows in its first five trading days. However, note that GLD’s inflow is from just one vehicle compared to the nearly dozen ETFs taken in aggregate.The question now remains whether investor interest will live up to the optimistic expectations of issuers. Estimates vary but range from $10 billion to $100 billion of inflows expected by the end of the year. Those projections, to JPM, “seem increasingly unrealistic.” They look to GLD, which attracted around $3.5 billion during its first year. This suggests again that spot Bitcoin ETFs “will fall short of expectations.”Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, observers that “$1 billion in 2004, when SPDR Gold Shares ETF launched, is not the same as $1 billion in today’s money… While so far so good, the real success of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be clearer in the coming months.”\nFurther, as the chart shows, the great bulk of the funds moving into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs appear to have come straight from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has been around for a while and has converted to an ETF. Then there’s the awkward fact that the Bitcoin price has edged lower by more than 5% since the funds were launched. Gold was up around 1.5% after GLD’s first week of trading, so this is disappointing. (Bitcoin on Monday traded below $40,000 for the first time since early December.)To Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co., the existence of spot Bitcoin ETFs will help the price eventually as it gives the coin a boost of legitimacy. It will just take time. “We have to remember that although gold rallied after the ETF began trading in November of 2004, it did pull back about 10% shortly thereafter and then traded in a sideways range for almost 10 months.” Brent Donnelly of Spectra Markets draws attention to a big difference with gold. While the metal was already recognized as an investable asset that responsible investors could hold, crypto is far short of that. Making it easier for small retail investors to get exposure to Bitcoin might help the price; but acceptance by the big and highly influential long-term institutions would make much more of a difference, and give other big investors the courage to take the plunge. That “first headline from Calpers, or Ontario Teachers, or ADIA” (the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority) or whoever could be a watershed moment when it comes. Barely a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed ETF investors into the cryptoverse, it appears there’s already a new question to answer: How long will it take to bring the biggest long-term investors around to crypto?—Isabelle Lee\n    Poet Amanda Gorman at the Biden inauguration.

Friday ended with the S&P 500, the world’s most-followed index representing more than half the entire value of global \n      Anatomy of an All-Time High\nHow did we get there? Friday ended with the S&P 500, the world’s most-followed index representing more than half the entire value of global equity markets, at an   all-time high. It was its first record since Jan. 3, 2022, and arguably brought to an end a   two-year bear market. Interest rates are far higher than when that last peak was made; the fed funds rate has risen from 0.25% to 5.5%. Inflation is well-above target by many measures. Polls show that the US populace thinks the economy is in a dire place. The bond market predicts a close-to-inevitable recession. So how can stocks set a record?This dashboard should shed some light. The recent rally has been led by the so-called   “Magnificent Seven” tech platform stocks, prompting worries that the market is too narrow and concentrated. Those concerns are overstated. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, in which each of the 500 members gets the same weighting, has indeed lagged the cap-weighted version, but not by that much. While excluding the Magnificent Seven keeps the S&P from its record, it’s very tight. Smaller companies have lagged, but if we use the S&P 600 index (known as the SML), the gap is not that great. S&P’s small-cap index excludes companies that have never made a profit, and avoids being weighed down by disaster stocks. Beyond that, the S&P has failed to get back to its 2022 high in terms of gold, or in real terms adjusting for US inflation. It has, however, completely walloped the stock markets of the rest of the world, and bonds:\nIs this rally about irrational exuberance, as  Alan Greenspan might have put it? Possibly not. A range of sensible valuation metrics show multiples are rising, but still significantly cheaper than at the beginning of 2022: \nThe leaders and laggards since Jan. 3, 2022, reveal that this rally is broader than credited. The effect of the most hyped stocks of the moment turns out to be quite complex. The company that has subtracted the most points since the last high is Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. Amazon.com Inc. is also in this list. Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., the makers of mRNA vaccines, also appear in the 10 worst laggards. In the chart, the bars refer to the number of S&P points accounted for by each stock, and to their impact on the total percentage increase of the index:\nFew will be surprised by the biggest leader: Nvidia Corp., maker of the chips that power artificial intelligence. Remove   Nvidia, and the S&P is not back at its record. But the list of companies that contributed most to the S&P’s rise since its last high include   Exxon Mobil Corp. and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Old economy companies have been part of this:\nIndeed, the best performing sector has been energy, gaining 40%. So, this isn’t an excessively narrow rally, and it only looks that way because the same narrow group of companies sold off most at first, and then led the rebound. It’s been achieved on slightly more realistic valuations than were available at the beginning of 2022, when optimism did look excessive.\n      But: Is It a Bull Market?\nIs this rally built to last, and is it a new bull market? Some will consider this meaningless sophistry. The S&P 500 has rallied by 35.3% since its nadir in October 2022, and is at a new high. How can this be a bear market?The first decade of this century shows that the question isn’t absurd. Is started with the S&P about to hit its  dot-com-era peak. A lost decade followed as investors steadily corrected the absurd speculation that had built up in the system. Two stock market crises ensued. But between those crises, the market doubled from a low ahead of the invasion of Iraq to a peak in October 2007. That peak came almost a year after bankruptcies of  subprime mortgage lenders began to scare credit markets. Was this a bull market? \nIn late 2007, in real time, concerns centered on anxiety over the economy and the credit market. Many felt that stock valuations were unrealistic amid such serious problems. They were proved right. Leaping in on the basis that a bull market had started would have lost you a lot of money. It makes more sense to talk of a bear market that lasted almost all decade, ending only in March 2009 when the trough of  post-Global Financial Crisis despair was reached. Low interest rates, and exceptional access to credit enabled by new structured credit markets, postponed the denouement. But ultimately the market needed to set a new low, even below its 2002-03 nadir. In any case, the S&P only briefly and marginally exceeded its previous high, and never did so when adjusted for inflation. It would still have been smart to be in the market while it doubled. Bear markets host frequent rallies, and there is money to be made by range-trading; it’s dangerous to be out of the market altogether. But the bottom line is to be careful about assuming that stocks have settled into an up-trend. Then there’s the bond market. The S&P started its more recent descent when the publication of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes for December 2021 revealed that the central bank was shifting toward ending QE (quantitative easing) bond purchases. Stocks tanked as rate hikes ensued. All else equal, higher bond yields should reduce the value that people put on stocks. That’s partly because higher rates increase interest costs and slow the economy, and partly because of a  substitution effect. If you can get a higher yield from Treasury bonds, with virtually no risk, it would make sense that you would want stocks to be a little cheaper, and hence pay a higher yield, to compensate you for the extra risk.\n    Valuing stocks over bonds requires the right measure of risk. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\nThis is the concept of the  equity risk premium, one of the most contested but most important in finance. Without getting into the thickets, here is a straightforward comparison between the 10-year Treasury yield and the S&P 500’s earnings yield (the inverse of the price/earnings multiple, or the effective yield you receive in earnings each year). It is the right to the future flow of earnings that you buy when you purchase a share, so this a sensible measure.Over the last three decades, this is how these measures compare. At the top in 2000, stocks yielded much less than bonds, a huge red flag. By the bottom in 2009, the earnings yield far exceeded Treasuries, signaling an obvious time to buy. Then, the yields trended lower together, thanks largely to determined intervention in bond markets. Low bond yields persistently justified higher valuations on stocks. In January 2022, stocks looked plainly cheap compared to bonds. They don’t any more. At times of late, the  10-year yield has actually been higher, for the first time in a decade. That’s what we might expect at the beginning of a bear market, not when we can declare a new bull run:\nIf we compare in terms of raw cash, with the dividend yield on stocks and the yield on three-month bills, so focusing on the most basic measures of cash flow, the picture is fairly similar. In the post-GFC decade, it became the norm for dividend yields to exceed the yields on bills. This is a potent illustration of how strong the support for stocks has been — if you get more of a cash return from dividends than you would get from very short T-bills, why not buy stocks? The January 2022 peak is marked. Stocks look far worse value on this measure now than they did then. Indeed, they look more expensive than at any time in two decades:\nSumming this up, the weird and repressive conditions that have endured since the crisis seem to be over. That’s good news, as the rise in asset prices has been achieved amid a widespread perception of rising inequality and misallocation of capital. It looks as though   valuations are returning to the norm from before the turn of the millennium (an era when it was still plenty possible to make money). In broader context, look at the research published on  the website of Robert J. Shiller, Nobel laureate economist at Yale University, whose framework for the long-term valuation of the stock market has set the debate for a quarter-century. This is how he presents his cyclically adjusted price/earnings (CAPE) multiple of the S&P 500’s price to average earnings over the previous 10 years, which he has calculated  back to 1880, against the 10-year bond yield. As expected, they have an inverse relationship. Historical experience suggested that after the extremes of 2000, 10-year yields would rise steadily while the CAPE on stocks would endure a low period. That didn’t happen, as bond yields were taken down ever further in the wake of the GFC. At this point (and Shiller hasn’t updated his numbers in the last three months), the CAPE looks very high by historic standards. The froth of early 2022 has been knocked out of the system by rising interest rates, but stocks remain far more expensive than when long-term rates were this high in the past: \nShiller’s suggested rule of thumb is the “excess CAPE yield,” which subtracts the bond yield from the CAPE yield. The following graphic charts the ECY against subsequent 10-year excess returns of stocks over bonds. On the face of it, the prospects for stocks, relative to bonds, are about as bad as they've been since the dot-com bubble, with a projected excess return of 1.9% per year for the next decade:\nHow much should we rely on these measures? There are reasons why the CAPE might rise over time. If higher productivity is ahead (which might come from AI), then it makes sense to pay more for stocks. Some of the current optimism is grounded in hopes for AI.But the bond market is still center stage. If bond yields consolidate at about their current level, it’s hard to justify paying the valuations currently demanded of stocks. If bond yields are about to fall significantly and stay there, then stocks look more attractive (and a 2% outperformance of bonds is also more appealing). Can that really happen? If bond yields stay elevated, presumably because inflation is sticky, then this new high will come to look like the high of October 2007 — a blip in a longer-term trend that helped sucker some in at the top. If the market is really right that bond yields will return to their box, then stocks can carry on into a true bull market. The former seems more likely to me, but neither can be discounted. Those are the stakes as US stocks celebrate their new record. \n      "

The latest exhibit from the \n      Second Thoughts, Proverbially Best…\nIs it really such a safe bet that the Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates early and often this year? The latest exhibit from the data to suggest that it isn’t came from the weekly jobless claim numbers, as good an early indicator as we have of how many Americans are being laid off. And last week, fewer people signed on as jobless than in any week since September 2022:\nThis is good news on many levels. Companies might be scaling back plans for new hiring, but  layoffs remain very low. This looks nothing like the approach to a recession. And indeed, entering this year, investors were ever more confident that a recession could be avoided. According to the latest global fund manager survey produced monthly by Bank of America, confidence in a soft economic landing, or even no landing at all, entered this year at its highest in this cycle. Only 17% of the fund managers surveyed now expect a hard landing:\nMeanwhile, the proportion who believe that a recession can be avoided altogether also rose:\nThe problem is that if the economy looks to be strong, then there’s less need for a central bank to cut interest rates. Indeed, if it’s running that hot, it could be an actively bad idea and drive overheating. A central bank that admits that in 2021 it made the serious error of allowing inflation to take hold is not going to want to cut too soon and let prices take off again.  However, fund managers started 2024 more confident than at any previous point in this century that rate cuts were on the way, according to BofA. And while their expectations of lower longer-term yields were tempered a little, the notion that it’s time to buy long bonds is popular:\nNumbers like the jobless claims report must force investors to think again. Indeed, the chance of a fed funds cut as early as the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee has been cut back, to judge by prices in the futures market. Such a cut was deemed a certainty at the end of last year; it’s now down to 56%, which still looks too high.That in turn implies  further strength ahead for the dollar. As the following chart, suggested by Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank AG, makes clear, the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro has recently been driven to the exclusion of almost everything else by the chances of a March cut. With the European Central Bank thought unlikely to lower rates before June, any such cut should directly weaken the dollar. Thus, the dollar has strengthened in the last few days as the odds have been adjusted, while numbers like the claims data suggest it will have further to rise:\nMeanwhile, higher bond yields haven’t led to a major stock market selloff, with the US moving roughly sideways for the year. That means that asset allocators who thought bonds were due a period of outperforming stocks (including many who answered BofA’s survey) have been proved wrong so far. Stocks’ driving outperformance of bonds, an almost permanent feature of the post-pandemic landscape, is back on track. The following chart compares SPY, the main ETF tracking the S&P 500, with TLT, which follows Bloomberg’s index of Treasury bonds of 20 years or more. The trend of stock outperformance appeared at last to be over; now it’s back again. \nWhy are the bets on cuts still so strong? Much of it derives from a reading of the Fed and its political motivations. The central bank is supposed to be independent. But let’s assume (as many do) that it’s driven by an urge to help Joe Biden retain the presidency, even though Chair Jerome Powell and influential governor  Christopher Waller are registered  Republicans. Early rate cuts might help their man, although it’s unlikely the effects would be felt much by voters this side of the election. Any monetary easing at any point this year is going to run into accusations of  political maneuvering from Donald Trump. Nobody wants to get on the end of Trumpian opprobrium. Announcing a pivot toward rate cuts last month arguably makes it easier for Powell to relax conditions while denying ulterior motives. But the stronger the economy remains, the harder that will be. Even after the ructions in the first weeks of this year, futures still predict a 3.75% fed funds rate by January of 2025, down from the current effective rate of 5.33%. Without some significant deterioration in the economic data, that estimate still needs to be revised upward. \n      What’s a Bitcoin Worth? \nIt’s been exactly a week since US regulators approved the splashy debut of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs. Now, Wall Street can begin to judge whether these shiny new products were indeed all that they were made out to be. The verdict? Actually, great. BlackRock Inc.’s Bitcoin ETF, for instance, passed $1 billion in investor inflows, making it the first in the group to surpass that milestone. Fidelity Investments is a close second. BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the biggest providers of investments on the planet, have driven early consolidation in the new asset. They have received 68% of all inflows across the new ETFs on the market — but there has been more money to go around. Here’s a nifty chart from colleagues:\nWhat’s less clear is how the long-awaited arrival of these ETFs will affect the performance of Bitcoin itself. On Thursday, the price of the largest digital currency hit its lowest level since the new funds were approved. The ETFs, and the money they’ve brought in, seem to have driven only a blip to date.It comes as the debate intensifies over exactly   how Bitcoin — or other cryptocurrencies — should be valued. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the most influential banker of his generation, remains convinced that it’s best not to put a value on it at all. He told CNBC in Davos that his personal advice is for folks not to get involved in Bitcoin, adding that was the last time he’s “ever going to talk about” it. He might find it difficult to stick to that. The philosophy of the late Jack Bogle, who revolutionized investing as the founder of Vanguard Group and as the chief progenitor of passive fund management, also weighs against the cryptocurrency. Bogle was uncomfortable with ETFs, arguing that Vanguard clients should buy and hold for the long term, and that it was wrong to encourage trading on exchanges. The company eventually swallowed hard and offered ETFs, but   has refused to present the Bitcoin ETFs on its platform on the basis that it’s an inappropriate investment. The way the price rallied on anticipation of more cash coming into the ETFs, and then initially giving some of it back, does indeed imply that the cryptocurrency is still being used for short-term speculation rather than anything else. However, there are interesting theories on how Bitcoin is establishing itself as digital gold. Dhaval Joshi, investment strategist at BCA Research, suggests that while Bitcoin has no intrinsic value as such, it is worth something because it’s so difficult to take away. There are, he says, three ways our money can be confiscated: 1. Through monetary inflation, which confiscates the real value of our wealth by stealth.2. Through the failure of banks and other financial institutions that have custody of our wealth.3. Through the outright expropriation of our wealth as, for example, was suffered by European Jews in the 1930s.Bitcoin’s key virtue, he argues, is that it cannot be confiscated by any of these methods. This makes it superior even to gold, which is immune to inflation and bank runs but can be physically stolen (as Jews and Roma people found out during the Holocaust). There are ways a determined criminal could steal your Bitcoin, too, such as holding you at gunpoint until you surrendered the keychain for your digital wallet. But this would be hard work for a government to do on a grand scale. Gold does have uses for jewellery and for industry. But in the era when it no longer backs currencies, the most value, Joshi suggests, has come from its role as a superior bastion against confiscation. He charts the ratio of gold’s price to silver, which was stable historically and presumably based on their respective intrinsic values. Once inflation (a means of effective confiscation) became a real risk, gold took off:\nAssuming a price of about $500 per ounce if there were no liquid market and central banks didn’t hold it, Joshi argues that gold’s monetary value ($2,000 per ounce) exceeds its intrinsic value by four times. Favoring gold over Bitcoin because of its lack of intrinsic value, on his argument, is a mistake because it only factors in 25% of the investment. The rest of gold’s value comes from its network.This is Joshi’s arithmetic: The market for non-confiscatability is worth $15.3 trillion and will grow in line with global wealth. Bitcoin should displace gold because it’s harder to confiscate. If it doubles its share of the non-confiscatability market to 20%, while the number of coins in circulation reaches its upper limit, its value could more than double while gold moves sideways. There is a risk that Joshi acknowledges, which is that people don’t use Bitcoin and stop seeing value in it. If there is no longer a network of people transacting in the cryptocurrency — possible if governments take steps to bar it — then it’s worth nothing. It’s in this network that the value of a cryptocurrency might reside. \n    At the New York Stock Exchange on the first day of trading for Bitcoin ETFs. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\nCharlie Morris, a veteran of the gold market who these days is chairman of Crypto Composite Ltd. in London, argues: “In my opinion, the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is zero, but that doesn’t make it worthless. What is the intrinsic value of the Mona Lisa? Does it matter?”He adds that while non-confiscatability is appealing, it doesn’t necessarily mean that a crypto token has intrinsic value. Morris points out that there are more than 20,000 tokens available; about 99.9% are worthless even though they’re impossible to confiscate. “They have no value because they have no network.”But as Bitcoin’s network widens, and it enables transactions with more people around the world, so its value increases. If the value is as a function of its network, that makes it very much like the “Magnificent Seven” internet platform companies that have established dominance in their fields and now look unassailable. “It’s a blend of liquidity, brand, application, development, trust, and distribution,” says Morris. “Winner takes all.” Presumably, the arrival of Bitcoin ETFs will only enhance that network.A counter-argument is that while Bitcoin in your digital wallet cannot be seized easily, the same does not apply to Bitcoin held in an ETF. One of the key founding notions, dating back to Satoshi Nakamoto’s first manifesto setting out the currency, is that the token allows individuals control over their money by excluding the banking system. That advantage is compromised by holding Bitcoin via ETFs. Expect this argument to run and run.—Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      "

The election in Taiwan threatened to be a major geopolitical flashpoint and sc\n  Shanghai Surprise\nEveryone was braced for trouble in Chinese markets this week. The election in Taiwan threatened to be a major geopolitical flashpoint and scare off investors. Then Saturday’s presidential result came in largely as expected, the status quo on the island largely seemed intact, China said little or nothing about it. Chinese stocks traded calmly on Monday. Since then, they’ve tanked. The progress of Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tells the story well:\nIn broader context, investors seem to have suffered a cathartic loss of confidence in China wherever they were based. Onshore shares quoted in Shanghai and Shenzhen (represented by the CSI-300 index) dropped to a five-year low. Chinese stocks quoted in Hong Kong and the US have fared far worse. Such lack of faith is an important event in itself:\nSo what happened? It’s best to start with the economy. \tThe EconomyWednesday brought a slew of data that painted a bleak picture of China’s recovery. From the persisting property sector downfall as home prices fell the most in almost nine years, to continued deflation risks after a measure of broad price changes recorded its longest stretch of quarterly declines since 1999, it’s possible the numbers prompted investors to lose patience. To get the numbers in a long-term context, take a look at Bloomberg’s estimate of nominal GDP in dollar terms over the last 30 years. Mexico, which in 1993 was just slightly bigger on this basis (with only a 10th of the population), is included for comparison. China’s growth has been extraordinary, the defining shift in the global economy of the last generation. But its period of uninterrupted growth looks now to be over. Once the weakening yuan is taken into account, it’s actually contracting slightly in dollar terms:\nSure, China hit its official growth target for the year, but it failed to shake off several of the problems that have been dragging down growth. Gross domestic product grew 5.2% in line with expectations. (Premier Li Qiang, in fact, revealed the number in Davos, Switzerland, a day before the official figures were published.) China’s brief post-pandemic rebound last year ran out of steam within months. That gave way to hopes that a disappointing recovery would prompt authorities to open the spigots for another big round of stimulus. That rosy scenario has also now been dashed. Li gave his clearest signal yet that Beijing won’t resort to huge stimulus to revive growth amid the worst deflation in decades:\nTo Crit Thomas, global market strategist at Touchstone Investments, there may be some wisdom down the line in the decision to hold off. “They’re kind of in a box,” he said in an interview. In some respects, not pouring on the gas to the Chinese economy, probably, in the longer term, is the right thing to do. You have way too much debt. Why would you throw more at that? And I think President Xi has realized this quite some time ago when he created those  three red arrows for the property sector.Dampening the recovery, among others, is indeed the property sector. It’s been a major headwind for the economy. Officials have been increasing pressure on developers struggling to repay debts and complete projects. Even if China has vowed to meet “reasonable financing needs” of all property developers, some were still uncertain how such efforts to ease cash crunches will pan out. As this chart from Oxford Economics’s Louise Loo shows, the property sector has been by far the weakest link in China’s investment:\nFor another indication of just how brutal this decline has been, TS Lombard offers this chart of the amount of residential floor space sold over the last 20 years. Sales are now back down to their levels a decade ago:\nProperty weakness makes consumers reluctant to spend their money and attacks confidence. While retail sales rose 7.4% year-on-year in December, they missed analysts’ estimate of around 8%. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Marvin Chen noted:The details are a bit more concerning, with retail sales below expectations and unemployment ticking up, which suggests consumer sentiment remains low… Sentiment remains the key drag on the economy and markets, which is more difficult to stimulate than something like fixed asset investment.As it is, China’s consumers have increased their savings rate again, less than a year after the economy reopened from the draconian Covid-Zero lockdowns. Falling property prices, making people feel less financially secure, may be to blame. That’s illustrated by Oxford Economics:\nPascal Koeppel, chief investment officer at Vontobel Swiss Financial Advisers who oversees around $10 billion, remains cautious toward China overall. But unlike some, he views the real estate issue to be an isolated problem: “I think the Chinese government can handle it.”More pressing to him is the shift of production out of China, or so-called nearshoring. “China is really producing a lot of goods. And because of this very restrictive Covid policy in the last years and the supply chain problems that we have seen, global companies are starting to diversify their supply chains — that comes with certain costs, obviously.”\tInternational ResponseThe selloff came as power brokers were enjoying their annual powwow at the World Economic Forum at Davos. Jamie Dimon said investors considering making a move into the country had to be “a little worried” because “the risk-reward has changed dramatically.” In a CNBC interview, the longtime chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co. said that while China has been “very consistent” in opening up to financial-services companies, calculating the potential upside for US firms has become more complicated.Beijing is now turning attention to reducing the size and power of the financial sector. Marko Papic of Clocktower Group pointed to Tuesday’s high-level work conference on financial services and said it was “widely perceived by investors as a prelude to a comprehensive crackdown on the financial industry.” He pointed out that the conference concluded that “(regulators) must severely punish corruption and strictly prevent moral hazard while resolving financial risks” and that the industry must “prioritize righteousness over profits.”China’s authorities have long been preoccupied by the possibility of a local replay of the crisis that followed the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, and appear determined to stop the financial sector from getting even larger. At present, Papic points out, it’s almost as dominant within China as the US banking system is at home:\nPositively, China may be recognizing the risks of an over-financialized economy; more negatively, it is retreating further from the capitalist model and accepting lower growth. Wherever it falls on this continuum, the direction of travel is deterring investors.Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia, thinks the notion that China’s economy has peaked is “flawed” due to the untapped potential of consumer demand. “I’ve never really accepted the thesis that you see written in various parts of the world about peak China — that somehow China’s economy is peaking, slowing and then heading toward something worse,” Rudd told a panel in Davos. “As long as the Chinese consumer has confidence in the future, then the economy will continue to grow reasonably well.”This will be harder, however, if China has to face a further round of sanctions and trade tariffs. That leads to another explanation for the selloff: blame Donald Trump. He is known for hostile rhetoric toward the country. Tuesday trading started in China just as Trump was being called the winner of the Iowa caucuses, and the selloff began.   Trump himself has happily claimed responsibility. “I felt very badly for them,” he said. “You know why? Because I won Iowa.”Leaving aside whether a presidential candidate should be happy about causing a stock market to plummet, it’s not obvious that China would regard a second Trump term as so much worse than more of Joe Biden. As this chart shows, MSCI’s China index more or less exactly matched its US index during the four years after Trump’s surprise victory in 2016; since Biden’s victory in 2020, they’ve lagged by 60%:\nThe Trump trade war of 2018 damaged the Chinese stock market, but it was nothing compared to the damage that has been done as the US has tried to clamp down on national security issues under Biden. Another indicator that China’s competitiveness is suffering already — its currency is its weakest since the Global Financial Crisis. When taking account of inflation, its tumble in the last two years has been dramatic:\nConceivably, this could grow even worse under a second Trump administation. The former president’s words certainly stirred up worries about China. But a lot of bad news seems to be in the price.\tInvestabilityAfter the selloff, are Chinese stocks now so cheap that it’s safe for foreign investors to try getting involved again? The extent of political uncertainty still makes any investment speculative. “There’s going be parts of it that’ll be investible,” Touchstone’s Thomas said. “You certainly need to pay attention more to the language that’s coming out of the political side of things. And it can be fickle. I certainly wouldn’t want to stock-pick my way through China.”One constructive suggestion, from Freya Beamish of TS Lombard, is to concentrate on those Chinese stocks that pay reliable dividends. This is a measure that cannot be obfuscated. We know whether or not a company is paying out cash. If it does, we know that it has a reasonably positive attitude to corporate governance, and that it must be producing some cash flow. The dividend version of the CSI-300, focusing on regular dividend-payers, has been impressively stable during this selloff: \nAnother point, made by Louis-Vincent Gave of Gavekal, is that even if politics has rendered China uninvestible for Americans and Europeans, that doesn’t apply universally. China is so cheap that it could lure new investors to give the market another look, he says. “After all, China might appear uninvestible to a US pension fund or a European insurance company. But to a value-conscious Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund or to the family office of an Indonesian tycoon, China today might look anything but.”\tAbout Those Rate Cuts...Amid the negativity, it’s odd that nobody is billing the possibility of importing deflation from China as a positive in the war against inflation in the west. It should buttress the chance for rate cuts later this year. People may have been disinclined to view it that way because the big selloff in Shanghai and Hong Kong came amid surprisingly “hot” data in the US, and an alarming inflation print in the UK.\nThe data shouldn’t be that alarming — the miss was not that great, and inflation is still less than half its peak. So the reaction in the gilts market tends to confirm that prices had been taken too far and too fast, and that investors were already nervous about whether they had piled in too enthusiastically. This is the 10-year gilt yield since the beginning of last year:\nChina may yet help tame western inflation. But for the time being, it looks as though those disinflationary bets went a little too far.  —Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      "

Indeed, it’s just possible that the campaign and its \n      Pricing in Politics\nVery little that happens this year will matter as much for markets as the US election. Indeed, it’s just possible that the campaign and its result could move markets even more than what the Federal Reserve might do. Tuesday saw significant but unsurprising developments on both fronts. Donald Trump won the Iowa caucuses with slightly more than half the vote, and  no rival was established as his clear alternative. With another chance to derail him gone, his already strong chances of a  second term have strengthened. Meanwhile, the Fed governor Christopher Waller made a speech confirming that the central bank expects to cut rates this year, while ever-so-gently dialing back the prospects for how early and how deeply. He started by proclaiming that for a macroeconomist, “this is almost as good as it gets,” and that the trick of bringing down inflation without sparking a serious rise in unemployment could be pulled off.  However, the text of Waller’s speech included the following:When the time is right to begin lowering rates, I believe it can and should be lowered methodically and carefully. In many previous cycles, which began after shocks to the economy either threatened or caused a recession, the FOMC cut rates reactively and did so quickly and often by large amounts. This cycle, however, with economic activity and labor markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2 percent, I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past. So confidently has the market moved to discount a sweeping financial easing in 2024 that these words were enough to shift bond yields sharply upward. It made for a fun trading session in New York:\nIn the broader scheme of things, this can be seen as continuing readjustment after last year’s ramp up in rates and subsequent sudden turn. The 10-year yield is now bang in line with its 200-day moving average and where it started last year. Having overshot upward, and came down a bit too far, the Fed and the market are now edging to a level where both can be comfortable:\nIt would be unwise to call this much of a retreat. Using Bloomberg’s estimates of implicit predictions for the fed funds rate derived from the futures market, we find that traders are still predicting an even more aggressive easing now than at the beginning of last month. The shift in expectations since the start of November is impressive:\nThe foreign exchange market is where things get interesting. All else equal, a big Fed easing should weaken the dollar by making the US a less-appealing place to park money. It corrected sharply toward the end of last year. A welter of 2024 outlooks published last month suggested a high degree of confidence that the dollar would be weak for a while. So far, they look to be wrong, as the dollar has started very strong:\nThis probably has more to do with Trump than Waller. George Saravelos, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, suggests that much Fed easing has already been priced in. It will be hard for the dollar to weaken any further on speculation about rates. The same cannot be said of  the election’s political risks. On this, he had three premises:(a) it will be one of the most consequential political events for the rest of this decade;(b) there is very little priced;(c) because of [these] observations, the risks are that it is priced much sooner than the market expects.Everyone broadly knows the stakes in November, and nobody denies that any decision on whether to give Donald Trump four more years in the White House will have profound consequences. It’s not so clear whether Trump II’s economic policies would be positive or negative for the dollar. But in the short term, it does appear that anything good for Trump is also positive for the dollar. Alan Ruskin, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said that the FX path that “resonates best” among traders is “that the Trump effect is in part dollar positive by default,” precisely because it is negative for other important currencies like the euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso.\n    Onward to New Hampshire. Photographer: Mel Musto/Bloomberg\nThe trend is clearest in the Mexican peso, more exposed to the US than anyone else and with obvious reason to be apprehensive about Trump 2.0. A candidate who has floated missile strikes or an invasion to deal with drug cartels will be bad for the peso, whatever you think of the issue of border security. During 2016, the Trump effect on Mexico was remarkable:\nA Trump victory seemed almost inconceivable in January 2016, and the peso’s travails reflected the growing grasp that he might actually win the presidency. This time around, a Trump second term is extremely conceivable, at this point even likely. That might limit the extent of any shifts the campaign can cause. The peso weathered Trump’s first term relatively unscathed, but it’s currently very strong (back below 17/dollar having surged above 20 after the 2016 election). Investors don’t want to find out what happens once Trump gets his second attempt. The way the peso behaved Tuesday is strongly (and painfully, if you’re Mexican) reminiscent of 2016, and was its biggest daily reverse since US 10-year yields peaked last October: \nThe euro also stands to lose, thanks to Trump’s opposition to further US aid for Ukraine. Should he leave NATO altogether, as seems possible, the effect on the common currency would be drastic. The yuan might weaken in response to more Trumponomics; generally, when tariffs are imposed, the foreign exchange market tends to strengthen the currency of the country imposing them. All of these specific risks are big, but more or less impossible to quantify. Adjusting to the Fed’s change in direction was difficult enough. The chances are that it will look like a picnic compared to the dollar’s attempts to deal with the shifting balance in the presidential campaign. \n      The US, China and Two Search Engines\nBaidu, the search engine-based group regarded as the Chinese Google, is having a brutal time. Its stock sold off sharply after a Friday report — which the company has denied in a formal statement — by the  South China Morning Post that its artificial intelligence bot Ernie, a similar service to ChatGPT, was being used by the Chinese military. The story said that a research laboratory of the People’s Liberation Army’s Strategic Support Force, which runs Chinese cyber-warfare efforts, was testing its own AI on Ernie “to learn more about humans.”Even with Baidu’s rejection of any “affiliation or other partnership” with the lab, the story continued to scare investors. Its American depositary receipts dropped a further 4.5% in Tuesday trading after falling 7% on Friday. (It did   recoup some losses in Hong Kong after an even sharper fall of 11% on Monday.) While this is Baidu’s worst daily tumble in more than a year, it confirms a trend. While other Big Tech groups have surged since the beginning of 2023, Baidu’s ADR are down to their lowest level since then.Until Dec. 18, 2022, Baidu was included in the NYSE Fang+ index, along with the likes of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., one of the most popular ways to capture the growth of dominant internet platform groups. This is how it has performed since it left the 10-member index:\nVey-Sern Ling of Union Bancaire Privee told Bloomberg colleagues that it was logical for the stock not to regain all the ground it had lost, because “the doubt has already been cast in investors’ minds of potential geopolitical overhangs given its position as a leading AI player in China.” The  story’s ramifications for possible trade reprisals driven by US national security concerns are obvious, and justify putting a steep discount on Baidu’s shares. In broader perspective, Baidu tells the story of the capitalist world’s relationship with China since the Global Financial Crisis. Baidu, and all of China, surged in 2009 as massive fiscal and monetary stimulus helped it lead the world out of recession. Come 2011, with the commodity boom fizzling and rising concerns about the resilience of China’s financial system, that began to turn. Then, as disenchantment with the increasingly anti-private sector policies of Xi Jinping set in, China lagged ever further behind.The natural peer for Baidu is Alphabet Inc., still known as Google at the time of the GFC. Both are dominant search engines now well placed in artificial intelligence. This is how Baidu’s ADR has performed relative to Google since the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, on a log scale so the most recent selloff is visible: \nThis is emphatically not because Baidu has failed to grow its profits. On the contrary. This is how 12-month earnings per share has moved for the two companies, in dollar terms, indexed to the listing of Baidu’s ADR in 2006:\nChina’s economy is growing slower than it once did, but its expansion since 2006 has still dwarfed the US or Alphabet’s other major markets. Baidu has capitalized on this to the full. The gap in performance is instead driven by a radical shift in how much investors are prepared to pay for its revenues and profits. For the first decade after listing, Baidu traded at a persistent premium to Google in terms of its price-to-sales ratio, presumably because it offered direct exposure to China’s likely superior growth. That premium finally ended in 2015 and 2016, as China’s currency was devalued and global confidence slipped. Baidu began to trade at a discount to Google, which was almost eradicated during the brief bubble in Chinese stocks that ended in early 2021. Now, it’s trading at a gaping discount:\nFew expect China to grow significantly slower than the rest of the world. Baidu is also a great bet, given its well-fortified competitive position, to be relatively recession-proof, much as Alphabet and the other big tech stocks are regarded in the US. The case for slapping on such a big discount, as the reaction to the SCMP story demonstrates, rests entirely on the perceived geopolitical risks. If Baidu is co-opted into helping the Chinese military effort, in any way, that would make it toxic, and certainly uninvestable for westerners. Stepping back, even very high-quality Chinese assets can now be bought really, really cheap. Any investor who monitors the political situation will understand why, and still be reluctant to buy. If US-Chinese relations were somehow to make a clear improvement, somebody would stand to make a lot of money. \n    Klaus Schwab, back again. Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg\n      "

They enjoy more market power, enabling them to drive better deals; they can put up with liquidity far better than most; and they have a long time-scale. Very influential, others tend to follow them. For some, their size can turn into a source of systemic risk. People rely on pension funds. If they fail, that creates terrible problems, while any bets they make can move markets just because they’re at such scale. Just think of the UK’s   gilts crisis in the autumn of 2022, which happened because many pension funds had made the same leveraged bet that rates would fall.Increasingly, pension and sovereign wealth funds are also being drawn into the political battlefield. Whether state funds should use so-called ESG strategies (screening for environmental, social and governance factors) is a  hot potato in the US, while public funds face pressure both to invest more at home, and to eschew certain countries for political reasons. Israel and China, for very different reasons, now take some political courage to invest in. So it matters what they plan to do. And the latest look ahead from Norway’s giant $1.5 trillion Norges fund, the sovereign wealth fund charged with reinvesting the money it derives from oil, is significant on several levels. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, its chief executive, Nicolai Tangen, said he was pessimistic about returns as he saw continuing inflationary pressure. This runs counter to the current consensus, but as his fund controls 1.5% of the world’s stocks, it matters.The Norwegian approach to home bias and ESG is also interesting. The idea is to help protect Norway from declines in oil revenues, so it  doesn’t invest in Norwegian stocks and puts money into alternative energy. This is not so much lack of patriotism (as some in the US might describe it) as very prudent risk management.\n    Nicolai Tangen at Davos. Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\nIn terms of broader asset-allocation decisions, Norges is still heavily invested in stocks, but the trend for many big asset owners is toward bonds — a downward force on yields. Norges is very much at one with the general move toward ESG management, for all the political furor it has caused in the US. Mercer recently published its first  Large Asset Owner Barometer, which covered 61 asset managers controlling some $2 trillion. It found a slight majority planning to reduce their US equity exposure (22%, against 19% planning to buy more). Confidence in the UK seems appallingly low, with only 3% planning to expand as 19% intend to cut their British exposure further.The asset classes where they say they’ll be expanding this year: investment-grade debt, private credit, infrastructure, and sustainability strategies. “The clear direction of travel is toward greater allocation into sustainable investments and private markets” managed by external managers, says Mercer. There are concerns that private markets may find it difficult to deliver returns amid higher interest rates, and that they are effectively hiding volatility by not offering transparent pricing. Despite all that, 39% plan to up their holdings of private credit, and 30% will increase private equity. Big managers are also increasingly unapologetic about ESG investing. The great majority of large funds say they have targets related to climate change and net zero. As many as 29% say they incorporate strategies on DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion), another  radioactive political topic: \nWith many asset owners now firmly committed to this path, the risks of upheaval resulting from this year’s US elections look considerable. The greatest concern, as ever, is over pensions. In the US, many defined benefit plans are being slowly wound down, but they still have to honor promises made to many current employees and retirees. Those liabilities can be crushing. As they’re generally funded by buying bonds, they grow more expensive as yields fall (and hence bonds are more expensive). The persistent negligible rates after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 put such pensions under great pressure. The good news is that that pressure is lifting with higher rates, but perhaps not as much as might be hoped. The  Equable Institute published this estimate of total unfunded liabilities (the amount by which the current cost of liabilities to pensioners lags current assets in the portfolio) for public pension funds in the US. It’s not pretty:\nCorporate plans didn’t get into so deep a hole. By Mercer’s estimates, the defined benefit plans of S&P 1500companies have now got back into surplus. That’s good news for their employees and for investors in the companies who were worried that they might have to use shareholder funds to top up the pensions; on balance, it’s also a reason to think bonds might be favored over stocks. Now that these managers actually have a surplus, the incentive to play safe by moving into bonds will be that much higher:\nPublic pension funds haven’t made any such strong improvement. This is Equable’s similar exercise for US public funds:\nHow are they dealing with this? Equable shows that the trend has been toward a steady move away from public equities and to a lesser extent bonds, and into private equity and hedge funds. The notion that these alternative assets can perform better in the long-term seems to be firmly entrenched now:\nIt’s a little concerning that public pensions remain in such a deep hole — on the face of it leaving politicians with a choice between forcing higher contributions or dipping into taxpayer funds — and that they’re relying on private assets to get them out of it. To quote Equable:Valuation risk continues to grow, as public plans have not adopted any widespread reduction in their allocations to private equity, real estate, or other asset classes that lack transparent market pricing, despite declining valuations. For any given pension fund this may be the right choice, but the industry trend as a whole is a concern.Big fund managers have an impact. They have had much to do with the boom in private assets; the disquieting possibility that they could help drive a bust for those assets in future can’t be dismissed. \n      Better-Than-Expected?\nFollowing the  Iowa caucuses, we get the corporate earnings season for the fourth quarter of last year. They have much in common. Both are driven largely by desperate attempts to manipulate expectations ahead of time, and then create what is often an overreaction. Where they part company is that earnings, in the longer run, need to be taken much more seriously than the results in Iowa, which in its 48 years as the opening event of the presidential nominating candidate has produced winners like Tom Harkin, Richard Gephardt, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz and Pete Buttigieg. Much like candidates trying to convince the press that they’ll do badly in the caucuses so that they can harvest “better-than-expected” headlines, so companies routinely deprecate their numbers in the months leading up to publication. Particularly big write-downs by the pharmaceutical companies Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. make the way companies have talked themselves down over the last three months look particularly drastic. Once they’re excluded, as this chart from Savita Subramanian of Bank of America Corp. demonstrates, this season’s expectations are bang in line with the norm. And look how rare it is for companies to talk themselves up entering the earnings season:\nLooking deeper, it’s interesting that the excitement over the Fed’s pivot toward lower interest rates at the end of 2023 had almost no effect on earnings forecasts. It’s fair that projected future changes in monetary policy should have minimal impact on corporate profits in the present, but the very significant fall in long-term rates might be expected to make a difference. The following chart from Andrew Lapthorne, chief quantitative strategist at Societe Generale SA, demonstrates that there has been very little move in earnings projections for months:\nThis season has more than the usual customary traps. Thanks to the artificial intelligence boom last year, and the lingering effects of the pandemic, results will be more than usually dispersed. As Bankim Chadha of Deutsche Bank AG shows, companies particularly affected by Covid disruptions are expected to show a 266.5% rise in profits year-on-year, and the overall forecast of an anemic 2.3% growth for the S&P conceals some very bearish forecasts for much of Corporate America:\nQuarter-on-quarter, he shows, the consensus is actually braced for a decline after last year’s very strong third quarter. Some of that is driven by one-time charges for big pharmaceutical companies, but he still argues that the current earnings predictions make little sense unless investors are also braced for a recession (which many other market indicators show that they aren’t):\nPerhaps the biggest issue concerns margins. Profitability appears to have enjoyed a secular increase over the last decade — a phenomenon that many on the left would connect to growing inequality and disaffection in society. Inflation, the orthodoxy goes, makes it easier to sustain higher margins because companies find themselves with more pricing power. So, as Subramanian shows in this chart, the current projected margin for the S&P 500, with inflation coming down, is its lowest since the pandemic and no higher than in 2018 (although a decade ago people would still have thought it was a pretty healthy profit):\nMargins have been far more resilient than many expected for a long time now, so this suggests scope for a positive surprise. Putting this together, Chadha, and Subramanian, suggest that we could be primed for a big upside beat, as earnings expectations are unduly bearish. In the weird post-pandemic conditions, it wouldn’t be the first time the market has suffered confusion. Earnings began to trend up last year, on the back of economic growth. As profits tend to move in long cycles, it would be very unusual for them to reverse swiftly. Away from tech and the companies most badly hit by the pandemic, there does appear to be a lot of pessimism.But then we come to usual post-Covid contradiction. The earnings cycle and the monetary policy cycle are in very different places. The market is braced for steep rate cuts, probably beginning as soon as March. Historically, such cuts are very unlikely unless the economy is in trouble, which means that earnings are falling. Over recent history, moves in the fed funds rate overlap so closely with trends in earnings that it begins to look like the infamous “Fed Put”; when earnings are under pressure, the central bank helps out with cheaper money. This chart is from Lapthorne:\nIf the market is right that we’re at the beginning of an earnings expansion cycle, and yet interest rates are about to come down significantly, then there will be a lot of money to be made in US stocks this year. But can that really happen? Brace for more evidence from CEOs and CFOs over the next weeks, but don’t expect them to resolve the issue for us. \n      "

Thursday’s update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that both th\n      Disinflating Disinflation\nAmerica is disinflating, but it’s doing so disappointingly slowly. Thursday’s update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that both the headline and core measures of the consumer price index had shown less disinflation than hoped. The headline number is prone to the vagaries of changing base effects and volatile food and fuel prices, but it’s still usually the figure that is most discussed and has greatest political salience. So it seems worth pointing out, pace Ben Hunt of Epsilon Theory, that this most watched measure of inflation hit a low last June and has been rising ever since. Even then, it was higher than had been seen in the years before the pandemic:\nHeadline CPI isn’t, and shouldn’t be, a measure that drives what the Federal Reserve does next. For that, we need to look at what’s now known as “supercore inflation,” covering the services sector excluding shelter. These businesses are particularly sensitive to wages. This measure also suggests that disinflation has stalled. It’s not just about base effects, but also high on a month-on-month basis: \nThe focus on core services seems justified as it now effectively accounts for all inflation. As this chart from the Bloomberg economic analysis (ECAN <GO> on the terminal) shows, it’s higher than the headline, meaning that all the other components net out to less than zero:\nThe trimmed mean measure published by the Cleveland Fed is beloved by statisticians. It excludes the biggest outliers in either direction and takes the average of the rest for a good measure of core underlying inflation. On a year-on-year basis, disinflation continues but has become painfully slow. The month-on-month version has risen for the last two months, having hit a low last summer. This seems to confirm a picture of a disinflation which if not totally stalled or reversed is disappointingly slow:\nThe clearest reason for hope is that the BLS’s methodology for shelter inflation tends to be seriously lagged, meaning that it might well be overstating rental inflation. That’s important because CPI excluding shelter is back below 2% — and shelter inflation is falling, though slowly:\nIn the context of expectations of a faster fall, and the dominant narrative that inflation has now been licked, this was a disappointing report. Not disastrous, but certainly not strengthening the case for imminent rate cuts. Rather, it appeared to confirm fears that the “last mile” of disinflation to get back to the Fed’s 2% inflation target was going to be difficult, with the easiest gains now in the past. Tiffany Wilding, economist at Pimco, summed it up as follows: The deflationary impulse from normalizing supply chains is a tailwind that will eventually fade. Shelter inflation continues to slowly cool, and services ex-shelter inflation remains sticky — supported by still-elevated wage growth. We think this backdrop is likely to mean that disinflation, which was incredibly fast by historical standards in 2023, could be slower and more complicated in 2024.Jeff Schulze of ClearBridge averred that the print “confirms that the process of disinflation will not be a straight line down, requiring further patience from the Fed before officially transitioning towards an easing cycle.” He added that core goods inflation ticked into slightly positive territory for the month, breaking a streak of six consecutive declines. Taken together, he concluded, “This print should put some modest upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields as near-term expectations for rate cuts are pushed out slightly.”Of course, 10-year yields fell for the day (and had done so before news of strikes against the Houthis in the Red Sea gave reason to be nervous about oil prices again). The immediate reaction to the inflation news was taken as a great buying opportunity, and brought the yield back below 4%:\nIt’s hard to see how the Fed can start cuts as early as March, with disinflation stalled and inflation still above target. Yet federal funds futures barely moved. They still discount five cuts this year, while the chance of a 25 basis-point cut in March is still put as high as 63%. The market odds on a cut briefly exceeded 90% in the aftermath of Jerome Powell's dovish performance at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting; but this now seems an overly high belief in rate cuts:\nWhat can explain it, other than complacency? The numbers are a tad disappointing but not terrifying, while shelter should help bring overall prices down a bit further. They weren’t a game changer, particularly given the widespread belief that the last stage of disinflation would be the hardest. But the critical driver is the market’s interpretation of the Fed’s reaction function. If the central bank is really happy to start cutting with inflation still above 2% to avoid overshooting, and if it’s truly in the tank for Joe Biden in an attempt to boost the economy before November’s election, then December’s report needn’t stop them from cutting in March. This line of argument isn’t dumb, and may well be correct. If so, it suggests a nasty resumed inflation problem for whoever wins the presidency. But it’s startling to see how much confidence has been invested in that narrative.  —Reporting by Isabelle Lee\n      To All Who Would Bet Against America...\nWhen it comes to stock markets, U.S. exceptionalism is alive and well. Ever since the Global Financial Crisis, US stocks have beaten everyone else, year after year. This chart shows how MSCI's US index has fared relative to the rest of the world:\nSuch dominance isn’t inevitable. After the dot-com bubble burst, the US lagged for several years. Europe’s total market cap briefly overtook it by some definitions. And on the face of it, the chart above seems to beg for a reversal. The accumulated strong performance, and ever higher valuations compared to other countries, suggest that there must be better value elsewhere.That’s why people like me persistently argue that it's time to diversify away from the US. We’ve been proved wrong for a decade. The case against the US stock market remains clear, and it’s plainly well understood by some of the most prominent US bulls. So let’s go through the arguments made by Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani of Goldman Sachs Investment Strategy Group, who issued their annual outlook Thursday, titled “America Powers On.” It’s been making a consistent “Pre-eminent America” call since 2011, which has worked well. What’s impressive is that Mossavar-Rahmani and her colleagues obviously listen for the arguments against their bullish view, because they produced a succession of charts that directly attempted to counter virtually all the bear points currently out there.First, Goldman accepts accept that the US market is expensive — relative to bonds, its own history, and other countries — a finding that would be confirmed by more or less any sensible metric. This is Goldman’s own measure of the equity risk premium, or how expensive stocks are to bonds. It makes the S&P 500 look its most expensive in over 20 years:\nHowever, buying US stocks 20 years ago wouldn’t have worked out too badly, so buying when the equity risk premium is low isn’t necessarily such a bad idea. For the very long-term investor, stocks tend to go up, so buy them.Goldman’s critical next point is that valuation is no reason to sell at any given time, because it’s of no use in timing. This following chart shows the level of the cyclically adjusted price/earnings multiple at the end of each year since 1945, mapped against subsequent 10-year returns. The relationship is minimal. There’s little or no inference you can draw from today’s multiple for predicting returns over the next 12 months:\nGoldman’s approach here is a tad short-termist. The same exercise comparing current multiples with returns over the subsequent decade, rather than year, would show a much stronger relationship. Over time, you tend to pay a penalty for buying when a stock is expensive. But the point being made here, reasonably, is not to try to be clever about market timing, or to exit the US in an attempt to profit from an imminent reversion to the norm. It could happen, but there’s no particular reason to think it will. If if does, there’s also little reason to think that the rest of the planet will be exempt.This is where Goldman tries to deal with the next stage of the argument, which is that more or less everywhere else (with the sole significant exception of India) looks cheaper than the US. Again, they don’t deny this, as it’s a manifest truth, but instead suggest that the issue has been hugely overstated. The way to do this lies in the different sectoral weights of different indexes. The US notoriously is dominated by Big Tech companies unmatched anywhere else. There is no European Google or Facebook. Tech should naturally trade at a higher multiple than other sectors, even if there’s room for argument over how much more expensive it should be. In the next chart, other indexes are reweighted so that each sector accounts for the same proportion as it does in the S&P 500. In every case, this makes the foreign markets more expensive. Everyone except India still shows up as cheaper than the US, but not as a “screaming buy” compared to the S&P:\nWhat of the argument that the US has become dangerously concentrated in those giant tech companies, often known these days as the Magnificent Seven (Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc.), to which Goldman adds Netflix Inc. for its own “FANGMANT” acronym. These stocks dominated returns last year, and to many look like a bubble ready to pop. Equal-weighted indexes have grown in popularity as people look for ways to play the market while avoiding overexposure to the Magnificents.Goldman has an answer to worries about this one, too. In this chart, a decline in the p/e for the FANGMANT is shown against the increase in the p/e for the rest of the index that would result in the overall multiple being unchanged. A 7% fall for the FANGMANT multiple, half of the way to its median, can be balanced by a 3% increase for everyone else. Even a 14% fall would need only a 6% gain for everyone else:\nIs this an argument that concentration doesn’t matter? It’s true that plenty of stocks did well in 2000 and 2001, in absolute as well as relative terms. The era immediately after the dot-com bubble made the reputations of many a hedge fund manager and value investor. The overall S&P 500 still had a pretty torrid time.But it’s true that plenty of voices are making the call that the US has plenty of cheap stocks. If they mean that, then maybe the over-concentration can indeed be corrected without forcing a broader bear market. Another bear point is that rate cuts are generally bad for stocks; it’s been made often in the last few weeks since the Fed signaled that cuts could come earlier than expected. If the Fed is cutting, it’s because it has reason to do so, and that reason is usually a recession. Goldman counters with this chart showing performance in the year after the first cut of a cutting cycle. They’re divided into times when a recession started within those 12 months (in red) and when the economy kept growing (in green):\nThis isn’t an argument to buy stocks even if you think a recession is coming. If you’re negative about the economy, that should definitely temper your expectations for the stock market. But it is an argument that easier money pumped into a healthy economy can be very bullish indeed. One final bear argument that Goldman tries to dismiss: Corporate interest expense and the risks that debt burdens will start to hit. That’s a worryingly plausible argument for smaller firms, but they point out that many S&P 500 companies have negotiated fixed rates, and less than 10% will need to be refinanced this year. Despite all the rate hikes of 2022 and 2023, the interest rates paid by the biggest US concerns are still barely off the bottom:\nHow to respond to this? The economic call remains critical. If it turns out that a recession has only been delayed, not averted, then this is not going to be a great time to hold American stocks. And some of the arguments make a strong case against market timing, or attempting to get in and out of the market, while still failing to address how difficult it will be for the US to keep steaming ahead over the next decade.Jumping out of the market can go badly wrong. It's always dangerous to be out of stocks, and particularly US stocks, altogether. That said, it might be an idea to reduce exposure to the US just a bit, for anyone with a decently long investment horizon. And now, let’s wait for the S&P to prove Mossavar-Rahmani right and me wrong yet again...\n      "

        "content": "        The day came at last, to the sheer joy of the crypto faithful — and the profound displeasure of skeptics. After Wednesday’s market close, th\n      Finally Approved\nThe day came at last, to the sheer joy of the crypto faithful — and the profound displeasure of skeptics. After Wednesday’s market close, the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the first time approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in Bitcoin. Issuers were given the green light, including industry heavyweights BlackRock Inc., Invesco Ltd., and Fidelity Investments as well as smaller competitors like Valkyrie. All will begin trading Thursday. The presence of such huge companies guarantees a much greater attempt to sell Bitcoin to small investors.  Perhaps paradoxically, immediately after the approval, SEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement reiterating that the agency does not endorse digital assets. “While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin,” he wrote. “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.”That seems reasonable. As the regulator for securities markets, Gensler also needs to ensure that investors are adequately warned against the risks that might come with any securities that the SEC permits to be traded. Some took umbrage. Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood told Bloomberg Radio  in an interview aired on X: “He just denigrated the whole crypto space. I couldn’t believe it. This is par for the course in disruptive innovation.”\n    Gensler seemed less than whole-hearted. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg\nSo why did the agency approve it, in what was a rare capitulation to immense opposition? Colleagues Katie Greifeld and Vildana Hajric explain:At the crux of the SEC’s previous rulings against a spot ETF was the argument that no regulated exchange was able to adequately monitor Bitcoin trading in a way that would reliably detect fraud and manipulation. That contention was opposed by Ark, among others, which provided data showing a high correlation between cash trading and the futures contracts that trade on CME Group’s platform.In reviewing the latest set of proposals, the SEC said it examined the correlation between spot and futures trading at a variety of time intervals and concluded prices moved in such a way that irregularities on exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase were likely to show up in the futures.Here is how the SEC justified itself in the formal order, stating clearly that the introduction of Bitcoin futures made it very hard for the commission to block further financialization in the form of ETFs:Because the CME’s surveillance can assist in detecting those impacts on CME Bitcoin futures prices, the exchanges’ comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME — a US regulated market whose Bitcoin futures market is consistently highly correlated to spot Bitcoin, albeit not of “significant size” related to spot Bitcoin — can be reasonably expected to assist in surveilling for fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in the specific context of the proposals.Much is resting, therefore, on the concept that the futures market has already brought crypto assets sufficiently into the financial mainstream. Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, a Wall Street watchdog group, reacted furiously, saying that the SEC had come to the crypto world’s rescue “by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans.”He made clear that he didn’t accept the argument that regulated Bitcoin futures provided enough protection for investors. “Bitcoin and crypto are worse than the chips you can buy at a casino because at least the casino is regulated; the spot Bitcoin market is not and that’s what the ETF is going to be pricing. There will be no SEC regulation or policing of Bitcoin.”The approval comes after the SEC’s X account was compromised Tuesday by a fake post claiming that the agency had green-lit plans for the products. This fueled a brief surge until it was deleted minutes later, and Gensler posted via his own handle that there had been no approval:\nIt remains to be seen  how markets will act as trading in the new ETFs gets underway. The potential pool of investors is wider now, but that doesn’t mean that cash will flood in Thursday morning.  Over the longer term, however, the precedent of the gold market’s response of State Street’s bullion-backed ETF, known by its ticker symbol GLD, is promising for those hoping crypto prices will rise. Though other factors were also at work, the ETF instantly made it far easier for retail customers to invest, and was widely seen as a critical force behind gold’s bull market after two decades in the doldrums:\nStandard Chartered Plc suggested this week that Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 by the end of 2025 on ETF approvals, citing gold’s example. The firm expects investor inflows of $50 billion to $100 billion into Bitcoin ETFs this year alone. That remains to be seen.For now, it surely is a milestone for the roughly $1.7 trillion digital-asset sector. “A spot Bitcoin ETF isn’t just a financial instrument. It’s a significant and practical move towards integrating crypto into the mainstream,” wrote Sheila Warren, chief executive officer at the Crypto Council for Innovation. When Bitcoin’s investors increasingly are the same people who hold stocks and bonds, and will now be able to trade between those assets in the same account, that should ensure that Bitcoin comes more closely to correlate with them and to respond to the same forces. That’s what happened to commodities or emerging markets when they were opened to passive investment, and it’s fair to assume that financialization will also change how Bitcoin behaves as an investment.Even after Gensler went to such lengths to say that the SEC wasn’t giving any seal of approval to Bitcoin, the odds remain that this will expose many more people to crypto’s risks and opportunities.  — Isabelle Lee\n      Immaculate?\nStand by for the concluding US inflation report for 2023, and just possibly the latest step in the road toward a potential “immaculate disinflation” — in which inflation would come back down to target without major job losses. Such an outcome would be great, and its chances have improved over the last few months. If it happens, then the  central bank can cut rates, which is what many desperately want to see.How good are the chances really?  Expectations for the December inflation report, due Thursday morning in the US, are skewed toward the downside, with the median prediction of economists polled by Bloomberg News expecting core CPI to log a fall and drop below 4%:\nThat data will tell us a lot, as it always does. For now, let’s check on what might divert disinflation off its immaculate course. If we divide inflation into price rises driven by rising demand and those caused by tighter supply, indexes kept by the San Francisco Federal Reserve show that both are in a very promising decline. These measures aim to show the amount of core CPI driven by demand and by supply. Both are somewhat higher than the norm for the decade before the pandemic, but both are falling swiftly:\nSupply-driven price rises, moved by post-pandemic bottlenecks, peaked in 2022. Demand-driven prices, which tanked during lockdown and rebounded dramatically during reopening, have seen even greater disinflation. What are the risks to continuing falls?\t\t\n      Demand\n\tIf people have more to spend, they will likely bid prices up. Wednesday saw the publication of the Atlanta Fed’s wage tracker numbers, which  follow rises in pay using census data. Here, the good news is that wage rises are higher than they were during the slow economy that followed the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. That should be good for social cohesion. The bad news for central bankers is that disinflation has stalled, with overall wage growth sticking at 5.2% for the third successive month:\nThe  Atlanta Fed’s website is a great resource for getting a granular view of the US labor market. One data point that is a tad concerning covers the difference between part-time workers, who had a really terrible deal in the last data, with full-timers. Part-time workers closed the gap in wage rises in 2022 before falling back a little — and their raises are now moving upward again. That is particularly important for prices charged by the services sector, which makes wide use of part-timers:\nTo be clear, this in all probability makes for a happier and more equal society; but it could also mean service prices go up. Wage growth is almost certainly too high for the  Fed’s comfort, given the great emphasis it’s put on the labor market. Disinflation, and lower rates, will surely require lower wage rises than this. Wage inflation has stalled at exactly the level it reached during the boom of the late 1990s. This is the full dataset from the Atlanta Fed, on both a smoothed and non-smoothed basis:\n      Supply\n\tThe problem with interrupted supply chains really appears to be at an end. The Institute of Supply Managers’ monthly survey asks companies whether they’re experiencing slower deliveries. In both the manufacturing and services sectors, fewer than 10% now say that this is a problem. Extreme bottlenecks have been eased:\nThis lies behind the fall in supply-driven inflation. The problem, however, is that leading indicators suggest that supply is getting constrained again. The following chart shows various measures of freight container shipping prices, including the World Container composite measures, as well as the rates for shipments between Shanghai and Rotterdam (which requires going through a canal) and Los Angeles (which doesn’t), as well as the Shanghai Shipping Exchange measure. Rates remain far below their peak from 2021 and 2022, but they have just leapt alarmingly:\nThe cost of air freight has also just registered a sudden jump. \nThere are myriad factors behind changes in transport costs, but one that’s clearly at work is the return of hostilities to the Middle East. Until now, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, now entering its fourth month, has had no obvious effect on global prices. Most importantly, it hasn’t impeded the fall in gasoline prices in the US. They spiked after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but have so far proved impervious to the fallout from the conflict in Gaza:\nCritical now is the threat to shipping using the Suez Canal, driven by  attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen. Beyond that, the South China Sea carries about a third of global shipping trade, and is also the source of global tension ahead of this weekend’s election in Taiwan.  Above all, the focus has shifted to Iran, and whether it is drawn explicitly into the Gaza conflict. The Houthi attacks continue unabated, and raise the risk of what Jean Ergas of Tigress Financial Partners calls a  “Dien Bien Phu moment,” referring to the French defeat in Vietnam in 1954 that led to the buildup of American involvement in the country.From the point of view of markets, the critical point of  escalation in the Middle East doesn’t concern the loss of life that might result, but rather the effect on the oil price. Iranian oil is finding its way into the global market despite sanctions. A serious attempt to stop it could have profound effects, even though no risk of this is yet apparent in prices.Speaking to the Citi Year Ahead Conference in New York, Peter Tchir of Academy Securities warned that people are talking a lot about geopolitical risks “but they aren’t doing much in the way of positioning or hedging for that… The risk is that Iran does something in the next few months that forces the US to do something to stop the selling of Iranian oil. It’s a 20% or 30% probability.”  Geopolitics are a concern not just because there are so many flash points, but because they could so easily drive an escalation in oil prices while re-snarling supply chains. That could yet halt disinflation.And now to wait for the numbers…\n      "

        "content": "        Taiwan goes to the polls Sunday. If the winner is Lai Ching-te from the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive Party, there will be some kin\n      Magnificently Risky\nTaiwan goes to the polls Sunday. If the winner is Lai Ching-te from the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive Party, there will be some kind of response from mainland China. Put aside for now the   nightmare scenarios (covered in  yesterday’s Points of Return) that this turns into a military conflict between the US and China. Neither country wants that. But what could very easily happen might hit the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have come to be regarded as bulletproof and risk-free. They’re in an extremely strong competitive position, but that doesn’t protect them from the possible consequences of the Taiwan election.Hence when   Bank of America published its list of the 10 biggest surprises to brace for this year, it gave pride of place to the possibility that geopolitical risk will affect these giant US technology companies (Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google-owner Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc.) that dominated performance last year. As BofA’s strategists put it:  According to CSIS [Center for Strategic and International Studies], the “Magnificent Seven” companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Nvidia use Taiwanese manufacturers for over 90% of their chips. Growing dependence has sent their correlation to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) to a record-high 66%. As those same companies comprise a record-high share of the S&P 500 index, the whole US stock market is more sensitive than ever to any geopolitical escalation that disrupts the supply of semiconductors. Tensions continue to mount in the region and we suspect the risks will be priced into mega-cap growth stocks in 2024.While the correlation persists, it’s also notable that Bloomberg’s index of the Magnificent Seven surged last year, leaving the American Depositary Receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. far behind. The geopolitically hazardous situation for TSMC seems to be reflected in its price, but not in those of the largest companies it supplies:\nConcern is amplified by the sheer scale of the Mag 7. Torsten Slok of Apollo Management shows that their market cap is now greater than that of the entire stock markets of Canada, Japan and the UK combined:\nVincent Deluard of StoneX Financial points out that last year alone, the companies grew their total value by a mind-boggling $5.4 trillion. That, he says, is as much as the combined market value of the four largest Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.If you’d rather compare them to other companies instead, Slok offers this chart of the ratio of the Magnificents’ market cap to the entire Russell 2000 index. They’re more than four times bigger:\nThe BofA team also points out that heavy concentration in tech has in the past signaled vulnerability to a market accident. With tech now such a globalized industry, such concentration also ensures that the market grows more exposed to geopolitics:\nNone of this proves that these stocks are about to collapse like a  blancmange. But it does rather ram home the point that a lot is riding on them. A significant reversal for the Magnificents would lose a lot of people a lot of money. How great is that risk? Gavyn Davies, chairman of Fulcrum Asset Management, argues that the short-term risk isn’t that great, because both the US and China are reliant on TSMC to develop their own IT industries, particularly in artificial intelligence, and know it: Neither the US nor China can risk losing access to TSMC production at any time in the near future, though both are attempting to grow their domestic chip design and production capabilities to make themselves less dependent on Taiwanese production.That was what the 2022  Chips Act was about, and the US has persuaded TSMC to build a big new manufacturing facility in Arizona. For Davies, none of the most strategic economic and military considerations for China would be changed by the arrival of a new president in Taipei. “Though very concerning in the long run,” he says, “these considerations are likely to play out over years or decades, not in a matter of months from now.”He’s probably right. But it’s still vital to be on the alert. \n      Byronic Surprises\nBofA’s list of surprises was an homage to  Byron Wien, one of the great Wall Street investment strategists over several decades. He passed away last year at the age of 90, and had been producing an annual list of 10 surprises to brace for since 1986.Blackstone, where he’d finished his career, had to decide whether to continue with the lists. The eventual verdict, laid out in a beautiful essay I strongly recommend by Wien’s successor Joe Zidle, was to retire them and move ahead with something different. The inspiration came from one of Wien’s own aphorisms: “Don’t try to be better. Be different.”\n    Byron Wien during a Bloomberg Television interview in 2017.  Photographer: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg\nWhile BofA memorialized him by publishing a new “10 surprises,” Zidle and Blackstone opted to commemorate Wien with a top 10 of his most prescient predictions. This was more than throwing ideas against the wall, or contrarianism for its own sake. The rule of thumb for a “surprise” was an outcome assigned a one-in-three or less probability by the market, but whose chances Wien put closer to 50-50. The lesson is that things can change far more than we realize; and also that there is huge money to be made by anyone who manages to be right when others are still wrong. That includes politics as well as markets. At the beginning of 2008, writing when  Hillary Clinton was far ahead in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wien predicted that Barack Obama would win in a landslide over Mitt Romney. He was four years out with the Republican nominee (who was John McCain), but he correctly foresaw that the weak economy would be the “determining issue in voters’ minds.”He also correctly predicted in 2012 that the US shale revolution would be a “game changer” for the energy market, while for 1999 he suggested that the Y2K problem (when the world’s computers would supposedly crash as the date changed from 99 to 00) would “turn out to be a hoax.” Programmers will indignantly respond that the IT community did a great job of staving off a meltdown. Either way, the millennium passed with scarcely a glitch. The liquidity the Federal Reserve had issued to tide through the potential disaster instead fueled the last climactic melt-up for tech stocks.Nevertheless, when the market perceives a chance of less than a third that something will happen, oftentimes it’s right. Wien’s last surprise in his final list was that by the end of last year, Elon Musk would have engineered a turnaround for what was then still called Twitter. This might yet happen; it certainly didn’t happen in 2023. \n      Paring Risks\nRisk parity, the supposedly steady strategy popularized by Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio that is meant to serve as an antidote to market surprises, is suffering volatility not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. That has now called the whole approach into question.Quant funds that employed risk parity saw their riskiness as measured by realized volatility levels surging 50% to 80% higher than their stated targets, according to a study from Markov Processes International obtained by Bloomberg based on results through November. It even exceeded the volatility of the traditional 60/40 portfolio (which holds 60% in equities and 40% in bonds and makes no attempt to adjust to changing risks). Risk parity went on to enjoy a great December, like everyone else, without closing the gap that had built up.The big insight of the risk-parity approach is to set a target level of risk, and then allocate between asset classes to achieve it. The key is to aim for an overall risk for the entire portfolio. Past correlations between assets, and their volatilities, go into the calculation. Funds can use varying leverage, or short selling, to reach the desired risk level.\n    Traders closing a banner year on the floor of the NYSE. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\nWhen both stocks and bonds rise together, then the strategy will do well. So it rebounded significantly in the last two months of 2023 amid optimism that the Fed would cut rates this year. But the point is that risk parity is supposed to generate steady gains. Most of 2023, it did not. Markov found that majority of the 10 popular risk-parity strategies it reviewed saw record levels of volatility, with a “staggering” gap between the winners and losers. As I wrote with my colleague Denitsa Tsekova, the cohort’s overall performance is lagging simpler strategies that offer lower volatility. “The strategy should protect you during crisis and protect you during rising rates, but often it doesn’t,” Michael Markov, co-founder and chief executive officer of Markov, told us.The volatility dragged the performance of Bridgewater’s flagship hedge fund lower by 7.6% last year, with all of the drop coming in the last two months. The lackluster results can be attributed to the strong equity gains and the underperformance of bonds. Risk-parity funds started 2023 far too heavily invested in bonds. As a result, the simple 60/40 portfolio beat the quant strategy for the year. The chart below shows the $626 million RPAR Risk Parity ETF and the Bloomberg Global 60/40 Index moved mostly in lockstep during the pandemic era starting in 2020. They began to diverge as stocks hit bottom and started to recover last last year. Since then, the gap has widened dramatically. The recent resurgence in bond markets hasn’t allowed the strategy to make up any ground: \nTo Andrew Beer, founder of Dynamic Beta Investments, risk parity “faces an existential crisis” and that “what worked yesterday isn’t working today and probably won’t work tomorrow.” He contends that it’s no different from other quant strategies: “Everyone looks great (and the same) until they go live. Then the luck of the draw means you'll have big winners and big losers.”The strategy was a victim primarily of shifting correlations. For the first two decades of this century, equity-bond correlations were fairly stable, and negative. If stocks went down, bonds tended to rally, making them a great way to hedge the stock market. But that long period of predictability went out the window when the return of inflation caused stocks and bonds to fall together. “The strategy is built on the simple idea that correlations among assets classes are stable and predictable,” said Beer. “That playbook was torn up two years ago.”—Isabelle Lee\n      "

Doe\n      Geopolitics. Why Bother?\nThere’s a lot of geopolitical risk around.   Most of the world’s people will get to vote on their nation’s leader over the next 12 months. Does it matter? After 2023, a great year for risk assets despite war in Europe and in the Middle East and ever greater confrontation between the US and China, it’s tempting to say that it doesn’t. If stocks can rally in such conditions, why care?Despite this, investors do care — a lot — and spend much time worrying about it. For one interesting indicator, the emerging markets team at Citi polled clients on what they perceived as the top concerns for the year ahead. Summarized here, the results showed that geopolitics in general and the US election in particular came out ahead of all the more conventional concerns about inflation, growth and monetary policy:\nThis is difficult, because investors find it really hard to handle geopolitical shocks. The response to them is usually diffuse, and refracted through many different layers.  Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 is perhaps the definition of what people have in mind with the phrase “geopolitical shock,” but it has proved to be the exception rather than the rule. The occupation came as an almost total surprise, and drove an instant market response. The S&P 500 briefly dropped into a bear market. It recovered swiftly once the issue was resolved via Operation Desert Storm, and the allied eviction of Iraq from Kuwait.Few shocks, however, are so clear-cut. The chart compares the S&P 500 in 1990 with 2022, when  Russia invaded Ukraine. Both horrifying events with obvious ramifications for energy markets, they had a very different reception. The S&P 500 actually gained on the day of Russia’s invasion, and after a swoon was briefly up until a bear market largely driven by higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve took over. Profoundly important though the Ukraine conflict continues to be, it had minimal clear impact on markets in 2022 (very much unlike Kuwait in 1990):\nTwo further examples of shocks that seemed to change everything when they happened, and did, show how difficult it is to read through from geopolitics to markets. The 2016 Brexit referendum in the UK sparked a dramatic fall, but the FTSE-100 largely dug itself out of its hole within months. The repercussions in terms of  political instability, and the very “Hard  Brexit” option that the country would choose, did not become clear until later. In 2001, the 9/11 terrorist attacks changed everything, and led to a brief and terrifying sell-off once markets reopened. All of that had been regained within weeks. Without 9/11, there was probably no Iraq war, and the history of the  last 20 years grows difficult to imagine. But the repercussions weren’t obvious at the time, and at first the shock was swiftly absorbed: \nThe  fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the collapse of the Soviet Union two years later, would have profound impacts on the world that are still being felt. The same is true of the  Tiananmen massacre from earlier in 1989. Nobody at the time could foresee how Russia would ricochet from Boris Yeltsin to Vladimir Putin, or that Deng Xiaoping would embark on massive economic opening in an attempt to offer the populace economic growth in return for doing without democracy. In economic terms, we now know that China’s entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was probably the single most important event this century, but it had no great impact at the  time. Or in the US, American involvement in Vietnam would have been very different without the Kennedy assassination, but it’s impossible to know how. In 1963, nobody had much idea what  Lyndon Johnson even thought about the issue. Without the Florida recount of 2000 that installed George W. Bush as president, it’s likely there would have been no invasion of Iraq three years later; It’s hard to see Al Gore agreeing to it. But no one raised any such possibility during the electoral thrills and spills in the Sunshine State.   So, geopolitics’ effect on markets is almost impossible to predict, but so important that it’s necessary to try. \n      Where There’s Agreement: US Politics Is a Big Risk\nEven with hot wars claiming more lives in  Ukraine and  Gaza, and with obvious risks that those conflicts will expand, the US is at the top of every list of geopolitical problems. The degree of polarization, the dysfunction of many political institutions, and the likelihood that the election will be fought by two deeply disliked candidates in current President Joe  Biden and former President Donald  Trump more or less assures this. The dynamics of the electoral college mean that the result could come down to tiny margins in a few  swing states, so the result is likely to be in doubt to the last minute (or even later). Beyond that, the various legal cases against Trump and the potential runs by several third-party candidates make the election even harder to predict. So does the gloomy but incontestable fact that either man would be the oldest president ever by the end of their term. The risk that a health event could change the whole contest and subsequent presidency is very real (but impossible to measure).  The impact will be global. Ian Bremmer, founder of Eurasia Group, points out that its outcome will affect 8 billion people, “and only 160 million Americans will have a say in it, with the winner to be decided by just tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states.” Dan Clifton of Strategas Research Partners suggests that the probability of the election winner will “correlate with entire country stock markets.” This is already visible in Mexico, where equities tend to gain whenever the Democrats pick up in the polls, and India, where they prefer the Republicans. \n    Biden campaigns at a church in South Carolina, where black voters delivered his first primary victory four years ago. Photographer: Sam Wolfe/Bloomberg\nThe political environment strengthens the likelihood that the incumbent administration tries its hardest to  stimulate the economy this year — positive for the short term but highly questionable for the longer run. Marko Papic of Clocktower Group contentiously argues that the Federal Reserve’s pivot toward easier money at the end of 2023 year is driven by the perception that Trump himself is uniquely dangerous. He adds that in the unlikely event that the Supreme Court upholds rulings in Colorado and Maine to disqualify him from being a candidate: “With Trump no longer a risk to the Republic, the Fed can go back to ignoring politics and doing its job.”But how will this affect the vexed relationship with China? That’s where the disagreement starts. \n      Where There’s Disagreement: US-China\nBremmer, the dean of geopolitical analysts, released his  annual list of the top 10 geopolitical risks, and the US-China conflict wasn’t in it. This is because he sees the domestic situation in both countries giving their leadership an incentive to dial down the conflict and “carefully manage the relationship’s decline as they weather any expected turbulence.” China’s economy doesn’t give the ruling party any scope for military adventures. By reopening a military dialogue late last year, both countries made clear that they wanted to reduce the tension.The problem is that no candidate for the US presidency has any incentive to be nice to China. With rhetoric likely growing more heated (even without any concrete steps on policy), that exacerbates the risk from any sudden China surprise. The Lazard Geopolitical Advisory team suggests that the “fragile US-China detente” will be put to the test:While hawkishness towards China is largely bipartisan, the election will drive more assertive rhetoric concerning Beijing. In these circumstances, an incident in US-China relations could spark a more escalatory response.The big moment of truth is coming up Saturday, as   Taiwan elects a new president. Current Vice President Lai Ching-te, who is in a competitive three-way race, stresses in his campaign that he no plans to upset the modus vivendi, but comes from the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive Party that is greatly distrusted in Beijing. China would have to do something in the event of his victory, but what? Papic argues that the response would likely be only symbolic (perhaps more economic sanctions or provocative military drills of the kind that followed the visit of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022) “given the ongoing US-China re-engagements and domestic constraints.”\n    How would Beijing respond to Lai Ching-te’s election in Taiwan? Photographer: Lam Yik Fei/Bloomberg\nStephen Roche of  Independent Strategy, a long-time China-watcher, is more sanguine, saying China could not deal with a decisive victory for Lai. “Forced to choose between backing down or delivering on his promise to integrate Taiwan by force, Xi will choose the latter,” he says. “By this time next year, Beijing will confront Taiwan with blockades or invasion. The West will defend Taiwan.”A military assault on the island would be the biggest geopolitical event at least since the fall of the Soviet Union. If that turned into direct armed conflict between the US and China, the world would be in the greatest danger since the Second World War. Both sides know it. For this reason, many contend, it won’t happen. Xi Jinping has enough problems already in dealing with the economy. US support for Ukraine arguably warns against Chinese aggression — although the present debate over aid for that country in Congress might change his calculation. \n      Where There’s Agreement: Deglobalization and Its Discontents\nWhere seemingly nobody disagrees is on the global direction of travel. You can call it decoupling, or multipolarity, or deglobalization, but ultimately, international flows of capital and goods are going to be slower. That should ease globalization’s deleterious effects, such as inequality in the western world, but also take an ax to its great advantages, led by the way that cheap Chinese labor kept inflation bottled for decades. Roche contends in his paper  The Economics of the Grayzone that geopolitical risks “tend to raise rather than lower inflation.” He adds: “This is because they disrupt the supply more than they diminish demand (not a foregone conclusion, but a fact).”He adds that two factors — the end of globalization and the return of big government — are inevitable (and the winner of the US presidency won’t change this). Globalization is “doomed by its failures and ignores its successes,” he says. A new consensus on reversing the misallocation of capital and attempting to rebuild industry with joint state and private investment (as can be seen in the  Chips and the   Inflation Reduction Acts). Meanwhile, he says that politicians on both left and right are far keener to allow government to intervene. Besides increased popularity, the critical driver behind bigger government is that a multipolar world with more numerous quiet conflicts will mean much greater emphasis on military defense, paid for by the state with taxpayers’ money.\n    A C-17 Globemaster, the workhorse of US military airlift. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg\nHow will globalization be unpicked? Daniel Blake and Jonathan Garner of Morgan Stanley suggest that there is an approaching fork in the road between “de-risking” and “decoupling.” The former would involve “a meaningful, but relatively orderly de-risking of critical and emerging supply chains and the associated innovation pipeline by 2030,” with corporations shifting foreign investment. The risk is that this turns into a decoupling in which “any accident or incident in the international arena could provoke a much more acute economic response and an associated retaliation.” The sparring between the US and China over access to technology, particularly when it has defense implications, is a strong example of this, and it would plainly be more dangerous. Roche argues that de-risking understates the issue with an unforgettable analogy:The official diplomatic semantics describe this trend as “de-risking” rather than “decoupling.” But if you buy less of a country’s stuff that is decoupling; de-risking only describes the speed at which decoupling happens, not what happens. It’s a bit like sex really; whether it’s over in a minute or an hour, it is still sex.There will be winners from this process.  Mexico, which also has a presidential election, is an obvious candidate to benefit from “friend-shoring,” despite its problematic relationship with Trump. Much the same is true for some countries in Eastern Europe, like Slovakia. The prospects for more capital expenditure and investment as the US and Western Europe try to rebuild their manufacturing base are rosy.How to deploy capital in this environment? Clifton of Strategas suggests that from an investment perspective, “this is the rise of the multipolar world” and therefore: “Stocks trade more like they did before the Berlin Wall came down: slightly higher inflation and interest rates, and lower price to earnings ratios on stocks.” In other words, the conditions created by the Fall of the Wall, and by China’s Great Opening, will steadily be reversed. Government will get bigger, and try to deal with inequality, which won’t be great for the stock market. It’s striking how many agree on both issues. It’s also very difficult to disagree.\n      "

        "content": "        Stock prices fell, so did bond prices, and a miserable time has been had by all. That is the story of 2024 so far. As two of the worst years\n      Overshooting. It’s What Markets Do\nStock prices fell, so did bond prices, and a miserable time has been had by all. That is the story of 2024 so far. As two of the worst years for US stock market history, 2008 and 2022, both started with a really bad first week of January, that’s already unleashed concerns that another horror year lies ahead.That’s overdoing it. The sample size for bad early Januaries leading to really bad years is two. There’s nothing to build an argument on. However, it does, as one of my friends keeps putting it, make sense to respect the price action. Investors want to retreat a little from some of their recent bullish bets, and it’s best to accept that. Why the turbulence? Friday witnessed a classic rollercoaster on the US Treasury market. First the raft of unemployment data came out at 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, followed 90 minutes later by the Institute of Supply Management survey of the services sector. This chart of the 10-year yield shows that these two data downloads had very different receptions:\nThe employment numbers portrayed a much stronger economy than had been thought, while the services data was surprisingly weak. You can read plenty more analysis   here. But to be clear, both were bona fide surprises in different directions.One nasty note from the employment data concerns the participation rate — the proportion of the population making themselves available for paid work. It dropped very sharply during the pandemic for obvious reasons, and had steadily recovered since late in 2022 to a point where it was almost back to the norm. The December data show a significant reverse. Enthusiasm for looking for work remains lower than it was pre-Covid. That implies a continuing tight labor market with employers forced to contemplate higher wages to attract reluctant candidates:\nMeanwhile, the ISM data was surprisingly weak. In particular, the proportion of companies expecting to increase rather than reduce employment took a dive. It’s not as bad as during the worst of the Great Recession. But, as the chart shows, this does look like a very stark signal of oncoming recession:\nSo, the direction of markets made sense, even if the data — taken conjointly — did not. By Friday’s close, the 10-year yield was back up above 4%, and had roughly returned to its level before the employment data came out. Looked at in wider perspective, it had also come to rest almost exactly on its long-term trend, as measured by the 200-day moving average:\nThat implies that the first week’s price action should be interpreted as an acknowledgement that expectations of massive rate cuts starting within weeks had been overdone. But not that there’s any need for a reversal. Using the Bloomberg World Interest Rate Probabilities function, this is how the number of implicit 25 basis-point cuts by the US election on Nov. 5 has moved since the Fed’s last rate hike in July:\nThe market is still braced for five cuts by November, which is a lot. Politics might help to explain this, as the Fed will want to start easing soon to avoid the impression that it’s manipulating the run-up to help President Joe Biden’s reelection chances. But it remains hard to see how the central bank could possibly justify cuts on the scale now expected unless the economy plainly slides into a recession (or some major financial incident increases the odds on one).So, what are the chances of a recession? This is where a dive into the weeds gets particularly confusing, and demonstrates how problematic it is that low response rates make the data unusually prone to errors and revisions.Generally, the employment market has a tendency to weaken slowly and then crack. That allows economists to build very strong indicators of recession based on the trend in employment growth. A steady deterioration can reach a threshold where sweeping layoffs become inevitable. The best known example of the genre is the Sahm Rule, named for Bloomberg Opinion colleague Claudia Sahm. If the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate (U3) rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months, the rule holds that a recession is starting. Three months ago, it looked as though joblessness was moving rapidly towards the 0.5 threshold. Not any more:\nThis is great news as far as it goes, but does rather imply that the Fed has no need, or even any justification, to cut overnight rates by more than a full percentage point over the next 10 months. However, the unemployment data is obscure. The following is a different “rule” very similar to Sahm’s, promulgated by Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research:\nWhy the difference in direction compared to the Sahm Rule? Joshi defends his own rule as follows:The Joshi rule real-time US recession indicator signals a recession when: the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate of ‘job losers not on temporary layoff’ rises by 0.20 percent from its low during the previous 12 months. [It] concentrates on this ‘bad’ unemployment — people who are unemployed because they have been laid off from permanent jobs and then can’t find re-employment. Right now, the number of layoffs is low, but those that are laid off are experiencing greater difficulty in finding re-employment. Hence, bad unemployment has been marching higher.Conversely, he adds, if the unemployment rate rises because more people are looking for work, then that could be considered “good” unemployment, resulting from a rising participation rate. The rate of participation is in fact falling, as we’ve seen, and that’s why this version of a recession indicator is so negative. Even though it tends to be gloomy, it still hasn’t hit a point that would clearly signal recession.For now, the rocky start to 2024 shows a healthy grasp from all and sundry that things got overbaked toward the end of last year. This is how it looked at the time, so it’s encouraging that emphatic bets on sweeping rate cuts have been pegged back a little. Some profits have also been taken, which is never a bad idea. The price action should be respected.What this isn’t, yet, is a serious reconsideration of the notion that the Fed executed its much-awaited pivot last year, and that this year will see significant monetary easing. It would need some nasty surprises in the forthcoming inflation data, or just possibly a big volte-face by the Fed, to make that happen. \n      Perception, Reality and Business Journalism\nJust why are Americans so unhappy with the economy? Both economic surveys and political pollsters find a strong perception that it’s in bad shape, even though virtually all standard indicators suggest robust health. The economy is growing, employment is strong, and inflation is coming down fast.There are plenty of answers out there. After the first big inflation spike in a generation, maybe people expect prices to return all the way to pre-Covid levels, even though history shows it doesn’t work like that. In an increasingly polarized nation, people share negativity on social media and only read sources that confirm their views. Republicans, trying to persuade us that things are bad, are doing a much better job of political messaging than Democrats. Though doubtless true to an extent, it’s hard to see how they could add up to such negativity. Ben Harris and Aaron Sojourner of the Brookings Institute try to address that in a new research piece entitled, Why Are Americans So Displeased With the Economy? Their answer acknowledges that there are many factors at work, but suggests that this truly might be a time to shoot the messenger. Mainstream news coverage really has grown more unremittingly negative, even than is justified by the data. That’s a process that started when the media were reporting on President Donald Trump in 2018 and intensified under Biden, so it’s not simply a question of polarization and social media echo chambers. Somehow, those of us in the mainstream media (I’ll use the phrase even though it’s a term of abuse these days) have indeed grown more negative.They base their study on the San Francisco Fed’s Economic News Sentiment index, which is culled from a range of news organizations. It’s been going since 1980, so if anything fails to give weight to the aggressively partisan news sources that have sprung up in recent years. Numbers below 0 indicate negativity and vice versa:\nNote that perceptions grew seriously negative last year. Biden’s strategists might also be at least a little heartened by the recent rebound, which has occurred as many commentators have thrown in the towel and apologized for getting their 2023 recession calls wrong. The San Francisco Fed’s website offers this detail of how sentiment has moved over the last 18 months, and it’s surprising:\nWhat could have prompted economic sentiment to dip so sharply in the summer of 2023? The banking crisis was not proving as severe as first expected, inflation was trending down, and employment was solid. But sentiment in news stories dropped seriously. The Brookings researchers looked for a model to explain this, and produced one based on four key indicators: inflation, unemployment, growth in gross domestic product, and the performance of the stock market. This last one is important. Stocks are closely watched, and a rising market will create a perception among journalists, consciously or otherwise, that the economy is faring well. All of this allows Harris and Sojourner to produce a predicted change in journalistic sentiment, if commentators reacted the same way as in the past to new economic data, and compare it to the actual tone. In other words, we can see if they grew more negative in interpreting data, not just in reporting it. And they did. The researchers conclude:The news tone has been more negative than the fundamentals would predict during 2018 to 2020 and even more negative than predicted in 2021 to 2023. Looking at gaps by year shows that the recent negativity seems to have started pre-pandemic in 2018. But the ‘negativity gap’ spanning 2021 to 2023 is about one-third larger than in the prior three-year period.Here is that insight in graphical form:\nSo yes, the way the media are presenting the economy would tend to give people a more negative perception of it than we would expect. That hurt Trump four years ago and is hurting Biden even more now.George Soros’s concept of reflexivity — the power of market indicators to affect perceptions of reality and thence create their own new reality — seems ever more relevant. Journalists have grown ever more accustomed to using the the markets as an indicator of the economy, and ever more comfortable with measures such as the yield survey that might not be functioning as usual in the weird post-pandemic conditions. In the process, we may have helped to convince people that things are worse than they are, which could in turn have real-life effects on their behavior when it comes to consuming, or voting. Certainly, I was convinced a recession was coming last year on the basis of usually reliable indicators. I imagine this had an effect on tone. And I wasn’t the only one. It’s not a cheery realization. If there is a ray of light, for consumer businesses or Democrats, it is that the gap has narrowed sharply of late as journalists catch up with the remarkable strength of the US economy in the second half of last year. If the data continue to be positive, it seems fair to expect the tone of economic reporting to improve, too. \n      "

        "content": "        The first data set piece of the new year is upon us. US payrolls data for December will be published soon after you receive this newsletter.\n      Garbage In, Garbage Out and US Jobs\nThe first data set piece of the new year is upon us. US payrolls data for December will be published soon after you receive this newsletter. The next round of hand-wringing will begin over whether the economy is sliding into recession, or whether it remains too strong to permit the series of interest rate cuts that many have now penciled in. Central banks the world over remain data-dependent, and very much does indeed depend on the data.That leads to a critical concern. There’s an ancient axiom of the computer world:  Garbage In, Garbage Out. The best computer in the world will produce flawed outputs if you give it flawed inputs. And there’s reason to fear that the current data on joblessness is, if not  garbage, then at least too weak to draw any firm conclusions. This chart, provided by Joe Lavorgna, chief US economist at SMBC Nikko, shows the percentage of companies that respond for the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ non-farm payrolls and job openings surveys (JOLTS). Response rates were never great, and their steady decline turned into an all-out collapse during the pandemic. The number of companies ticking their boxes has barely started to recover:\nLavorgna says he is left “wondering about the accuracy of the reported data when government statisticians are effectively forced to fill in the blanks.” Such issues can easily be seized upon by conspiracy theorists arguing that bureaucrats are cooking the books, but you don’t have to believe anything so sinister to be concerned. Without enough data to work with, the chances of getting it right are that much reduced.Meanwhile, despite the ritual excitement over the payrolls numbers on the first Friday of each month, stock markets are at least implicitly treating the JOLTS data, in particular, as though it can be ignored. If we compare the total number of vacancies shown in the survey since 2001 with the S&P 500, it’s clear that they tend to rise and fall together. When businesses are trying to expand their workforce, it makes sense that share prices would be rising. But there has been a complete parting of the ways over the last year or so. A retreat from an all-time high in job vacancies has coexisted with a rally for the S&P 500:\nOn the assumption that investors aren’t just dismissing the whole report, other explanations can be a tad concerning. To the extent that the JOLTS data can be relied on, Troy Ludtka, also of SMBC Nikko, points out that much of the decline in vacancies comes from cyclical sectors such as retail, accommodation and food services, and manufacturing. On its face, it really does suggest the economy is moving into a cyclical decline. All else equal, that shouldn’t be good for stocks. Ludtka suggests this must be predicated on expectations of “a productivity upswing, further fiscal expansion, and/or a reversal in Fed tightening.” He questions whether these expectations are reasonable. I would say that falling vacancies are plainly seen primarily as a reason to expect easing by the Fed. While that’s reasonable to an extent, the hopes being piled on it look excessive — particularly as the data may not be totally reliable.There are plenty more unreliable data to go around on jobs. The closest to a real-time measure is the weekly series on initial claims for jobless insurance, which is a good indicator of the rate at which people are being laid off. Every two weeks brings an update on the number of continuing claims, giving a broad idea of non-temporary unemployment.Claims data are unavoidably noisy. For example, a strike or a hurricane will cause a brief rise in layoffs. But if we use a four-week moving average to iron out the most extreme week-to-week distortions, we find initial claims are actually falling again, and remain far lower than at their peak last summer. Combined claims are still barely any higher than a year ago. The latest claims data were surprising, and argue against a significant deterioration in the jobs market:\nAnd for another unreliable data stream, try the estimate of private sector payrolls produced each month by ADP, a huge payroll-servicing company. This aims to predict the change in private-sector jobs a day or two ahead of Payroll Friday. As the following chart shows, it’s varied widely from the official number many times over the last two years. It can’t quite be dismissed as garbage, though, and the latest suggests a significant increase in the rise of payrolls. Investors are sufficiently rattled about this topic that the ADP number helped drive a rise in bond yields when it was announced. What comes now?\nThe broader picture from the data we have, to be clear, is broadly positive and consistent with a steady descent into an economic soft landing. Don Rissmiller, US economist at Strategas Research Partners, summarizes the picture as follows:Trends in place indicate the US labor market is normalizing and wage pressures are ebbing. Fed rate cuts are becoming likely in 2Q of 2024, in our opinion. Yet this is happening without firings or layoff announcements spiking much, keeping the door open for continued US economic growth. All of this is a reasonable summation. The prospects of an economic Great Escape continue to improve. But there’s reason to question the data, and a lot of money has already been placed on it. It will be interesting to see how December’s numbers are received. \n   Japan Exorcises the Ghosts\nFor the first time in what seems like an age, many are coming into 2024 with a slightly bullish tilt toward Japan. This is a new outlook, at stark variance with most of the last three decades, but there’s certainly a case for it. Enthusiasm started to build last year as the Nikkei 225 index hit levels not seen since 1990. The local Topix index soared 28% last year, besting even the S&P 500’s 24% advance.Several tectonic shifts took place in 2023 that shook off the notion that Japan is, as   fellow Opinion columnist Gearoid Reidy put it, a “land that optimistic stock bets go to die.” Key to the sentiment switch is belief that the days are numbered for the central bank’s Yield Curve Control (YCC), or intervening to keep 10-year yields down. The policy has been in force for seven years, but the Bank of Japan has recently opted to control yields “more flexibly,” which means in practice it will now tolerate yields as high as 1%, double the previous limit, as Points of Return discussed   here. On top of that, supportive headlines regarding shareholder-friendly policymaker initiatives (Warren Buffett went on a much-documented buying spree of Japanese trading firms) along with earnings upsides from companies propelled stocks higher,  GMO’s Drew Edwards and John Thorndike wrote in a white paper. Improved corporate governance was supposed to be the “third arrow” of the Abenomics attempt to revive the Japanese economy under former premier Shinzo Abe a decade ago. It may now finally have improved enough to make a positive difference for investors.All this has happened as most active managers remained “underweight and skeptical of Japanese equities,” Edwards and Thorndike say. That may be the fault of the Japanese yen, which was the worst performer among G-10 currencies last year as the other major economies hiked rates aggressively. Even so, the pair is bullish toward equities. “We believe Japan is undergoing durable fundamental improvements and lasting change in attitudes toward shareholders,” and predict that small-value equities are poised to deliver “strong absolute returns of 12%,” ranking them among their highest forecasts. They cite four reasons for their excitement:\t“Japan broad equities look about fairly valued and priced to deliver 4% real returns.” \t“Four recent policymaker initiatives should provide support for company fundamentals and shareholder returns.”\t“Active managers who dial into cheap small-value stocks stand to capture an additional 4% of returns.” \t“If the yen reverts slowly back to fair value, USD-based investors stand to pick up a 4% tailwind.”\nThe yen, as ever, is critical. It plumbed the depths last year, in part thanks to the practice of “carry trading” in which Japanese consumers parked their money in other currencies with higher interest rates. If, as is likely, the Bank of Japan does indeed start to lift rates this year, the chances are that this trend will reverse. If those repatriation flows do materialize, they would in themselves boost the yen and improve returns on Japanese stocks for domestic investors. Despite this, strategists at Societe Generale warn that the yen’s volatility remains a major risk. “A sharp move in the yen in either direction could challenge the Japanese bull market,” SocGen’s Frank Benzimra wrote. “Lower US yields are putting gradual incremental appreciation pressure on the market, in the absence of the BOJ hiking rates or completely dismantling its yield curve control.”They add that given their central scenario of the yen gradually reappreciating to 130 by year-end, then earnings will continue to rise steadily by around 9%, and predict the Nikkei’s advance to hit 36,000. They also point out that in comparison to the last 10 years (not a great time for the Tokyo stock market), stocks’ forward earnings multiples are almost exactly in line with the average. Valuations might make a good argument against other Asian markets, such as India, Taiwan or Korea, but if there’s any great enthusiasm filtering into the Japanese market already, it hasn’t shown up in earnings multiples:\nTo Bank of America, this year will likely mark a “crossroads in terms of whether deflation is fully over and corporate reforms bear fruit.” As markets enter the second year of a recovery in EPS, strategists including Masashi Akutsu wrote in December that P/E tends to lose steam and share prices are driven mainly by EPS growth. There is room for that, but it requires a successful battle against inflation. As they show, multiples at present suggest the market doesn’t fully believe the latest earnings forecasts:\nIf there’s one piece that remains to fall into place, it involves wages. Japanese salaries have been stagnant for years, but the lack of inflation has made that situation tolerable. Now, with inflation returning, real wages have taken the kind of sharp dip that usually comes before a rebound. The following chart to illustrate this is from Konstantinos Venetis of TSLombard:\nJapan’s wage negotiations tend to be frontloaded toward the early part of the year. If workers do indeed emerge with significant above-inflation pay increases, that would give the BOJ the confidence it needs that the deflationary psychology has at last been squeezed out. Value investors like to have a catalyst. Somewhat perversely, a high wage round that provokes rate hikes might just be it. —Isabelle Lee\n      "

        "content": "        You hear the word Goldilocks a lot at present. The catchall term for “not too hot, not too cold, but just right” implies great conditions fo\n      Goldilocks\nYou hear the word Goldilocks a lot at present. The catchall term for “not too hot, not too cold, but just right” implies great conditions for markets. And by the time midnight rang on New Year’s Eve, the world very much deployed on the basis that Goldilocks would indeed find her way through the woods. The prevailing belief is that this year will see significant falls in interest rates (helping bonds and stocks) in combination with a steady, slowly growing economy. Such conditions don’t happen often, which is why they’ve been tagged with the name of a fairy tale. But it could just happen. The first round of US data for 2024 is at least consistent with it. As mortgage rates have declined, approvals of mortgages for buying a house have rebounded from the low they hit in October. There is  much further for the housing market to go, but at least it gives Goldilocks a chance:\nThe latest bulletin from the US labor market is also almost perfectly in line with a Goldilocks outcome. The rate at which US workers are quitting their jobs, which hit an all-time high during the post-pandemic Great Resignation, is now  back in line with the norm. The total number of vacancies remains elevated, but is falling fast. That suggests heat leaving the jobs market (“not too hot”), but no serious decline (“not too cold”):   \nTo add to this,  manufacturing supply manager surveys show a slight recovery. The PMI data remain just below 50, intended as the demarcation point between expansion and contraction, and new orders are also unimpressive. But the survey suggests that both a recession and an overheating can be avoided:\nSo comforting was this data that 10-year bond yields even managed to fall after the publication of the  minutes from December’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting provided no hints that Federal Reserve was really prepared to cut as early March. Belief in Goldilocks is strong. And that’s important because the market, by betting on Goldilocks, has made it easier for such a scenario to happen. Rising prices for stocks and bonds tend to ease financial conditions. Judging by Bloomberg’s own measure for the US, they are now their easiest (expressed in positive territory in the chart below) in almost two years, since before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. \nWhat then are the problems with Goldilocks? Conceptually, such an economy generally only delivers great returns if nobody expects it. When markets have already set themselves up for just such an outcome, as we’ve just covered, not too hot, not too cold outcomes don’t help that much. Another concern is the alternative — what Max Kettner, chief equity strategist at HSBC, describes as the “Reverse Goldilocks.” For many years, markets traded in waves of “risk on” (stocks up and bonds down) and “risk off” (stocks down and bonds up). For the last few months, Kettner shows, there’s been a straight oscillation between Reverse Goldilocks and her sunnier sister. The last three FOMC meetings have provided the milestones. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish performance in September, several weeks of Reverse Goldilocks ensued. Everything went down (apart from gold). When there were hints of a U-turn at the next meeting, Goldilocks took over.  Everything went up (apart from oil):\nAt this point, that implies that Reverse Goldilocks is about to re-enter (and the last few days, with stocks falling while bond yields rise, might be consistent with that). For another way to illustrate this phenomenon, the following chart from Andrew Lapthorne, chief quantitative strategist at Societe Generale, shows the proportion of stocks in the S&P 500 and MSCI World indexes that are positively correlated to bonds (meaning they rise when bond yields fall). For the MSCI World, the proportion is the highest this century, and the share of S&P 500 stocks is even higher. The implication is that a renewed rise in bond yields, which might easily happen if inflation data prove disappointingly strong, could have a horrible effect on the stock market, whacking it back down as Reverse Goldilocks takes over:\nThat leads to another question. Just how can financial conditions be this easy? The most plausible answer is that liquidity, the availability of money from investment, has been growing even as central banks’ headline rates have risen. Note that conditions tightened drastically during the gilts crisis of October 2022 that followed the UK’s then-Prime Minister Liz Truss’s disastrously received mini-budget, and again during the US regional banking crisis last year — but swiftly returned to normal. Using the measures of global liquidity kept by CrossBorder Capital’s Michael Howell, it looks like liquidity hit bottom during the gilts crisis. Perhaps because that acted as a salutary warning to other central banks, there has been enough provision of liquidity since then to forestall the risk of an accident on that scale. This is how Howell graphs growth in the money base — the thick black line shows his overall estimate of global liquidity:\nIf we compare the 30-year Fannie Mae mortgage-backed benchmark, which has an implicit federal guarantee and is the closest approach to a “risk-free” asset outside Treasury bonds, we find that its spread to equivalent 30-year Treasuries recently reached as high as it ever has since the dot-com boom 24 years ago:\nThat can be viewed as extreme positioning in the mortgage market. But it could also suggest that Treasury yields are too low, possibly as a result of efforts by the US Treasury, through micro-managing auctions for raising funds, and the Fed. In other words, since the gilts crisis revealed what could happen, central banks have been leaning in to try to keep bond yields down. That in turn would imply that yields might not be telling the correct story. Famously, the yield curve (the gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields) has been  deeply inverted for more than a year, and yet there is still no recession. That becomes much easier to explain if there has been effort to keep longer yields down a bit since October 2022, even as rates have tightened. And if that’s the case, bond yields are too low, so their prices will have to go down as the strength of the economy grows clearer. That’s potentially bad news for a stock market that is now correlated with bonds, and prompts Kettner of HSBC to warn about a coming Reverse Goldilocks wave. For the economy, the implication is that all should be fine this year — although if inflation doesn’t readily come under control, then conditions could easily grow “too hot” for the markets. Next year, after the US election, could be different as bubbling liquidity implies a strong risk that inflation will be allowed to come back. But for now, Goldilocks remains on course through the woods. \n      Bitcoin\nIf there’s one asset that seems to jump when people have risk appetite, and to respond to greater liquidity, it’s Bitcoin. The largest digital asset jumped to a more than 6% advance over the first three days of January — hitting a 21-month high and bucking the sluggish start to 2024 in most global markets — only then to erase almost all its gains.The brief rally was buoyed by expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a batch of spot Bitcoin ETF applications as soon as next week. The Jan. 10 deadline includes judging the application filed by Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management LLC and 21Shares. “We think the probabilities have gone up because the SEC has been highly engaged compared to what was happening before,” Wood told Bloomberg TV last week. While she cautioned that an approval is not certain, she still proclaimed: “We’re as optimistic about Bitcoin as we’ve ever been.”  \nSuch talk from Wood is extremely reminiscent of the atmosphere in which Bitcoin surged to a high in late 2021. Is there any reason to believe an ETF could lift the currency out of its current extreme boom-and-bust cycles?Many view the approval of exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin’s spot price as a watershed moment for the industry. The belief is that such vehicles will democratize further access to digital assets. Still, some have cast doubt as to how much of a game-changer a spot Bitcoin ETF will be when it comes to inflows. Such claims were also made for the large crypto exchanges such as FTX and Binance; the market seems to be getting on without them. “The market is signaling an expected approval, which has a chance of being disappointed, so there could be more price volatility ahead,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. “The big unknown is what the impact would be on Bitcoin demand on the first day of trading – this, too, could end up being disappointing.”The main impact would be over the longer term as the issuers’ marketing machines gear up to educate the mainstream investing public, she said. Once the excitement dies down, the “crypto market narrative could well have pivoted to focus more on some of the other narratives driving prices, such as the easing of macro monetary conditions, increased currency volatility in many emerging markets, and growing global adoption.”Indeed, to others like Stephane Ouellette, so-called mainstream media have “really beaten the ETF story to an extreme.” Bitcoin’s volatility has been “quite typical.”“It is absolutely an incremental positive for some of the largest institutional investors to essentially open up crypto divisions,” said Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial, an institutional platform focused on digital assets. “Furthermore, a key factor for crypto-native investors is proximity to the spring BTC halving, which has been a surprisingly strong catalyst early in market cycles.”\n    A worker inspects Bitcoin mining machines.  Photograph: Bloomberg\n(Halving is a much-anticipated event that entails a planned reduction in the rewards Bitcoin miners receive. Many are on the lookout for how this may affect Bitcoin’s value. For context: The currency hit records after each of the last three halvings, which take place roughly every four years as part of the currency’s enforced scarcity. Read more in our QuickTake.)The problem might be liquidity. Bitcoin’s rally is a sign that there’s plenty of it. “This asset class is still one that tends to follow the flow of liquidity in the system. Even though the Fed is still involved in QT, liquidity is still plentiful,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “If that liquidity starts to become less plentiful (like it did in 2022), it will likely cause a pullback in the cryptocurrency markets in the early part of the new year.”Add Bitcoin to the assets that might be harmed if the Fed has to make a sudden reverse back toward fighting inflation, then. But for now, it’s getting on very well with Goldilocks.— Isabelle Lee \n      "

Jan. 3, 1984, saw the launch of the FTSE 100, and with it a big step forward in the way markets are \n  Forty Years On\nLondon has an anniversary to celebrate. Jan. 3, 1984, saw the launch of the FTSE 100, and with it a big step forward in the way markets are traded and investments made. It has been the most closely followed index of the corporate UK ever since. Its arrival was one of many innovations that transformed the City of London in the 1980s.The performance over those 40 years, sadly, isn’t much to celebrate. The following chart shows how the FTSE 100 has done in the 40 years since inception, compared to the S&P 500 in the US (its most obvious counterpart) and the MSCI World index of developed markets:\nThe trajectory has been acutely disappointing from a British perspective. But the excruciating lag is a recent development, dating from about three years after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The gap widened significantly after the Brexit referendum in 2016, but it would be too simple to blame everything on leaving the European Union; the FTSE had been trailing badly for several years at that point.Some of this is because the most-elevated valuations these days are in high tech, a sector that’s barely represented at all among UK-listed stocks. The likes of Apple Corp. and Nvidia Corp. should plainly aid the S&P 500. But a look at the numbers shows that the “Magnificent Seven” dominant US tech companies aren’t central to the valuation gap, although they have exacerbated it in recent years. Again, it’s notable that the FTSE only starts to be left behind a few years after the GFC:\nThe performance of RELX Plc, previously known during the FTSE 100’s history as the Reed Group and Elsevier-Reed, suggests that the FTSE might have done better with more tech companies. A large data provider, it’s the strongest performer among the original constituents, returning 36,151% over the four decades, and narrowly beating the tobacco group BAT into second place. It’s now Britain’s largest “TMT” (telecommunications, media and technology) group, and has been lifted recently by its investments in artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have much company in the UK.Another issue for the UK is the FTSE’s heavy weighting in international mining groups, which tend to list in London. When commodity prices are weak, as for most of the last decade, this drags on the index.Alternatively, it’s possible to blame Britain’s pension funds. Back in the 1950s, they pioneered what would become known as the “Cult of the Equity,” led by George Ross Goobey of Imperial Tobacco’s pension fund. Rather than stick to bonds, they piled into equities, which at the time yielded more. Over the last 20 years, that effect has moved totally into reverse. The following chart is from  Britain Plc in Liquidation, a startling report by Michael Tory of London’s Ondra Group, and shows how the proportion of equities in pension funds’ portfolios has fallen over time:\nFrom more than half of pensions’ funds under management in 1990, equities now account for less than 10%, a staggering reduction over a period when stocks have generally performed well. Pension funds are famously about the long term, which effectively enables them to pile into stocks, so why have they abandoned them?The main reason is the move toward liability-matching, which got going in earnest two decades ago, egged on by regulators and investment banks. With many defined benefit pension plans in deficit, meaning their assets did not cover their liabilities to pensioners, they began to buy bonds so that they could come closer to guaranteeing an income.This helped British gilts perform even better than US Treasuries. It also created a cycle, as lower bond yields made it more expensive to guarantee a future income, prompting more purchases of bonds and even lower yields. It led many British funds to make derivative bets on interest rates to stay low, a practice that culminated in the implosion of the gilts market in October 2022.Will Hutton, a veteran left-of-center economic commentator, even argues that they have forced the UK into a “doom loop” and created a system that is “rigged against growth.”\nThere is more to this issue than pensions. But one certainty is that fixing it will be difficult, because at a national level pensions seem close to impossible to get right. Just before the pandemic, the 2019 eruption of civil disorder in Chile shook many assumptions. The country’s pension system, adopted under the Pinochet dictatorship, had been widely regarded as the template for all to follow. The sight of Chileans rioting over inadequate pensions was terrifying — and might help explain why liability-matching might be a good idea.There’s also a risk of taking things too far. If British capital has oozed out of the UK stock market, it's at least in part because investors thought there were better returns to be had elsewhere, and they were probably right. And with capital moving so freely in the era of globalization, the whole debate over protectionism versus trade is coming back. This time, it’s over the international movement of money, rather than goods. Some of Hutton’s ideas veer close to a modern version of protectionism, or even to attempts to pick winners. For example, he suggests: UK companies in aggregate warrant their shares being bought, and, if all pension funds simultaneously directed disproportionately more of their assets to the UK, it would lift corporate Britain off the rocks. It is a classic case of where the state has to act decisively because the market can’t and won’t.I understand the point being made, and it’s necessary to stake out positions to move debate forward. But forced investment of pensioners’ money in British companies doesn’t sound like a good idea to me. That said, the FTSE 100’s unhappy birthday does suggest strongly that something is going systematically wrong with the UK stock market. Others take note.\n      Dow That’s Ridiculous\nEven if the last four decades haven’t been the greatest for London markets, there is at least one way they’ve gone ahead of the US. Prior to 1984, the ubiquitous benchmark for London stocks was the FT 30, compiled by the editors of my alma mater, the Financial Times. Modeled on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and in place since the 1930s, the index featured 30 big stocks chosen by the editors. Only mergers and bankruptcies could dislodge a member, and they were equally weighted. A selling point for the newspaper for many years, I started my career there in 1990 with a colleague whose job had once been to calculate the FT 30 every afternoon after the market closed, with a slide rule.At that point, such a service was a competitive advantage for which our readers were happy to pay. But data services have moved on since then, and it’s possible to calculate far more complicated movements by markets throughout the day and publish them in real time. As British journalists at  the Guardian and  Times point out, the 100-stock benchmark now turning 40 was initially set up by the London Stock Exchange in competition with the FT 30. It was received very frostily by my old bosses. Within weeks, however, they had instead decided to join forces and the name FTSE was born. The indexing group formed by the London Stock Exchange and the FT went on to greater things. These days, the FT no longer has a stake, and what is now known as FTSE Russell is controlled completely by the LSE. All of this sounds very similar to the history of the Dow Industrials, which spawned a family of indexes and eventually became part of the Standard & Poor’s indexing business under the same roof as the S&P 500. The difference, unfathomable, is that the tradition-lovers in London have lost all interest in the FT 30, recognizing it for the anachronism it is, while the modern iconoclasts in the US still insist on treating the Dow Industrials as if it matters, when it plainly doesn’t. After much searching, I couldn’t find the FT 30 on the ft.com website, or on Bloomberg. I did, however, find a fund managed by Phoenix Life which has tracked the FT 30 since 2002. It’s marked in green in the chart from the FT below. You can find it  here. The yellow line shows the performance of a fund which tracked the FTSE 100 for comparison:\nIf you wanted to make money, the FT 30 was not the place to be. If you just wanted to track an index, its equal-weighting and the big allocations to often declining and illiquid shares doesn’t help, either. The FT 30 is a grand piece of financial history, and like the Dow Industrials it helped open markets and aid understanding in its time. But that time has passed.The Dow Industrials doesn’t look anything like that bad, but only because its composition is now regularly being reverse-engineered to look as much as possible like the S&P 500. Most of the Magnificent Seven aren’t in it. In several cases, it chooses a smaller member of a sector over a larger competitor because this fits its price-weighting methodology (for example, it includes Chevron Corp. but not the larger ExxonMobil Corp.). The FT 30 does, I suppose, say that a group of strong, large UK companies have declined badly over the last decade or so. The Dow doesn’t tell us anything.So yet again, I suggest to all journalists and particularly those at Dow Jones that there’s no need to cite the Dow, and that there’d be no embarrassment in consigning it to the dustbin. Keep calculating it and publishing the number in the inside pages of the Wall Street Journal by all means. But admit that it’s obsolete. One possibility I’ve aired in the past: Change the name of the S&P 500 to the Dow Jones 500 (or “the Dow”) for short, do a one-off recalculation so that the S&P 500’s number equals the previous night’s close for the Dow, and carry on as before. Why not?\n      Hindsight Capital: The Video\nFor those who missed last week’s newsletters on what would have been the best trades of 2023, you can catch up with them now.

        "content": "        Welcome to 2024, which I can exclusively reveal looks a lot like 2023 so far. That doesn’t mean it will continue that way.As many of us in t\n  New Year’s Day\nWelcome to 2024, which I can exclusively reveal looks a lot like 2023 so far. That doesn’t mean it will continue that way.As many of us in the media have raked over during the holiday season, last year didn’t go as the great majority of economists and investors had expected. Those who were confident that there would be no US recession, or broad geopolitical conflict were proved correct. They should have made a lot of money as a result. That’s led to a natural assumption that 2023 ended the issue, and recession will still be staved off in 2024. To a lesser extent, it’s fostered a belief that those who were right will continue to be proved right.That’s where Rudyard Kipling comes in. Back in August 2007, the stock market sold off drastically as it felt the first waves of the subprime credit implosion. But it rebounded and even set new all-time highs in October. Those who’d made a big market-timing bet at the low looked really clever. It turned out from research I covered at the time that the opportunistic buyers were mostly retail investors, while the professionals running hedge funds tended to be on the wrong side of the trade. I began my column about it by adapting Kipling: “If you can keep your head while all about [you] are losing theirs/Then you’re a man my son.”One response I received offered an alternative rendering of the poem: “If you can keep your head while all about [you] are losing theirs/Then you have no grasp of the situation.” Sure enough, the market made a final peak on Halloween, and then began a dreadful 17-month slide. The hedge funds who’d taken evasive action in the summer were a little early, but by the end of 2008 they looked like the ones who’d kept their heads. The retail investors who piled in at or close to the top looked like the headless chickens. They took the loss.\n    Keeping your head was different in Kipling's day. Photographer: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty\nI learned from this. The  next time I cited “If,” I added the alternative version. And hence I am inclined to be careful now. I, in common with many others, didn’t expect what happened last year. Others got it right. But think of the hedge fund managers who got out of the market a bit too early in the summer of 2007. What we’ve just experienced doesn’t mean that the issue is settled.Having been incorrectly bearish in 2023, I’d like to structure this by looking at the reasons to be bullish, then check how confident we can be about them. So I’ll be guided by the veteran market economist Ed Yardeni, who called it right last year and has offered nine reasons to be bullish, along with three not to be too bearish, to counter negative points out there in the market. Here they are, with my comments:\tInterest rates are back to normalWe can cavil about exactly what a normal rate should be at this point, but it’s undeniable that rates have already come down a long way (apart from the shortest-term overnight rates over which the Federal Reserve has the greatest influence). The market has already executed a pivot on behalf of the Fed. One of the greatest reasons to avoid stocks and to fear for the economy has been removed.That said, real rates are positive now (higher than inflation), and still higher than at virtually any point since the Global Financial Crisis. There’s no question of returning to the rather weird normal that persisted from 2009 until the pandemic. The new one we’re entering still likely involves higher rates than that (unless the bulls are surprised by a recession).\tConsumers have purchasing powerThis was the crucial cause of many bearish mistakes in 2023. The assumption was that the excess savings built up during the enforced low spending of the pandemic would be used up by now. They haven’t been. Is that enough reason to expect the current  good times to keep rolling? That’s where it gets more complicated. Financial conditions have already started to ease, so some of the worst possibilities are off the table — people won’t be spending down their savings and facing intensely high interest rates. The fact that the US has continued this long without a recession, and is already easing conditions, strongly improves the chances that a recession can be avoided altogether.\n    Christmas shopping in New York. The new year won’t end the spree. Photographer: Eilon Paz/Bloomberg\nBut if the chances of a “soft landing” have improved over the last 12 months, that doesn’t mean that they’ve become overwhelming. Doug Peta of BCA Research managed to be right for the right reasons in 2023. He predicted that the consumer was in stronger shape than many thought, and that this would buoy both the economy and risk assets. His projection is that the excess savings will soon be used up. At that point, there’s likely to be a recession (although milder than once seemed possible.) “While we welcome the heartening data that have swollen Team Soft Landing’s ranks,” he says, “we won’t be applying for membership. A 2024 recession remains our base case and we think overheating is more likely than a soft landing if the expansion survives the coming year.”The mechanism for this: The excess savings, which Peta still estimates at $400 billion, will be exhausted by mid-year, while the lagged effects of all the higher interest rates will at last start to hurt. Given the current excitement among investors, that prompts BCA to predict a bear market for stocks as well. Timing, as many learned to their cost in 2023, is everything. Confidence will not be allowed to give way easily, and so the market can keep rallying. Peta suggests not turning bearish until it’s possible to see “the whites of the eyes” of a recession.\tHouseholds are wealthy and liquidThis is another area where the market has helped to create its own reality. Higher stock prices cheer up people who hold equities in their retirement portfolios, particularly when those savings vehicles are transparent and you can see your nest egg recovering in real time. That means a wealth effect — when people are wealthier, they tend to behave accordingly. America’s “mass affluent” are able to keep spending now, even if their extra savings from the pandemic have been spent down.Yardeni points out that a record $5.9 trillion is in money market mutual funds with a record $2.3 trillion in retail funds. These might turn out to be the conditions for a melt-up, but they do not suggest any great risk of a recession.\n    Especially in the services sector. Photograph: Bloomberg\n\tDemand for labor is strongThere are still 8.6 million job openings begging for willing workers. That implies a more robust economy than has been experienced at any time since 2008, and demonstrates that corporations believe they can grow further. That said, the record high vacancies showing up in the data were viewed with trepidation throughout 2023 as a sign that the labor market remained tight, and that wage pressures were rising. This applies particularly to the services sector, which is where the inflation and most of the jobs are these days. The labor market is consistent with a soft landing, but the risk of an over-heat or of “stagflation” as wage inflation propels broader inflation remain intact.\tThe onshoring boom is boosting capital spendingThis creates problems if you happened to be investing directly in China. Assume that China has enough shock absorbers in place not to fall into crisis as foreign direct investment turns negative and companies leave for the US or Western Europe (or at least for Mexico and Eastern Europe). But the mere act of “onshoring” involves new investment in plant. While onshoring continues — and the extent of offshoring over the previous generation means there could be much further to go — this will be a powerful force helping the economy.\n    US sales of previously owned homes are picking up. Above: Hercules, California. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\tHousing is set for a recoveryMortgage rates have plunged over the last two months. They remain high. But the sense that homeowners were trapped in their houses, unable to move because they couldn’t afford the extra costs that would come with it, should be much reduced. That’s all good. This scenario would be vulnerable to another reverse in rates, and would be helped by further cuts.\tCorporate cash flow is at a record high — $3.4 trillion during the third quarter of 2023.\tInflation is turning out to be transitoryYardeni points out that goods inflation was back down to 0% in November. The core measure of the Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator, reported quarterly with a lag and possibly the most influential data series for the Fed, weighed in at exactly 2% (the central bank’s target) for the third quarter. So it’s certainly very defensible to claim that inflation has passed through. What’s not so clear as yet is whether services inflation is also transitory. That largely depends on wages (see above). If wage inflation persists, and sticky services inflation stays at its current level or rises, that would be a nasty shock for the emerging consensus.\n    ZL Technologies at The AI Summit New York 2023.  Photographer: Bing Guan/Bloomberg\n\tThe high-tech revolution is boosting productivityArtificial intelligence promises to relieve human beings from doing medium-skilled and generally boring jobs. That should be really good for productivity, both because of the money it saves and the human capital it releases to do something else. We can argue over how great the effect will be, and whether it’s been priced in already, but there’s definitely something behind the AI hype. It shouldn’t be ignored.Now for the Yardeni responses to the most important bear points:\tThe leading indicators are mostly misleadingThe leading economic indicators have forecast a recession since late 2022. In particular, the yield curve has been inverted (meaning that short-term rates are higher than long term, a close-to-foolproof recession forecaster in the past) for more than a year as the Fed hiked short-term rates. Something is plainly up. At the very least, the continued expansion in the economy as the indicators suggest deterioration shows that this cycle is very unusual, something most of us had grasped already. But how safe is it to assume that they’re outright wrong? Yardeni argues: The LEI has misfired its recession signals because its composition is biased toward predicting the goods sector more than the services sector of the economy. There has been a rolling recession in the goods sector, but it has been more than offset by strength in services, nonresidential private and public construction, and high-tech capital spending.\tGlobal challenges should remain containedWe already have two very active wars that have caused great suffering and death. And yet neither the conflict in Ukraine, approaching its third year, nor the fighting between Israel and Hamas stopped the great market rally in the final months of 2023. Both have prompted big expenditures from the US and Western European allies, but neither as yet has expanded much beyond the initial direct combatants. A more aggressive China has not attempted to invade Taiwan, which has an  election coming up.\n    Russia accused Ukraine of shelling Belgorod on Saturday Russia Emergency Situations Ministry Telegram channel\nCounterintuitively, some of the effects have been positive for the US economy. Marc Thiessen, a conservative columnist at The Washington Post, points out that the great majority of the money being spent on aid and armaments for Ukraine is going to businesses in the US. Building weapons to help Ukrainians defend themselves against Russia creates jobs in America. Yardeni does have one bear point — all the government debt. It looks highly unlikely that the next US administration will start by taking strong action to rein it in. Both the leading candidates have presided over big increases in the deficit. The talk is of tax cuts, or more big government investments, depending who wins.\tAnd finally: What about 2025? And politics?The presidential election is bound to bring a bumpier ride, because it always does. Heightened emotions will only create a more difficult environment for risk assets. But usually, investors make their peace with the result — just think back to 2016, when markets sold off on polls suggesting that Donald Trump might have a chance of winning, and then rallied massively once he surprised everyone by doing so.\n    Swing-state politics: Biden at the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce... Photographer: Jamie Kelter Davis/Bloomberg\nThere are big problems with both likely candidates, and no need to rehearse them here. Sizeable numbers of people think either Joe Biden or Trump could be disastrous for the economy. What’s important to note about the “bull” thesis is that it implies that the economy keeps getting better. Generally, when that happens noticeably as an election approaches, the incumbent wins — as both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher managed after first guiding their countries through a recession. If rates come down and juice the economy, the odds are that Biden will win (which would be decidedly bearish for many). He would then face the risk of resurgent inflation, with minimal fiscal flexibility.\n    And a retired Ford Motor Co. employee in Detroit, Michigan. Photographer: Matthew Hatcher/Bloomberg\nIf the economy does finally lapse into recession, it’s hard to imagine Biden winning reelection. The nation would start 2025 in bad economic shape, with very little flexibility to spend. Trump would be back in the White House for a second term. Not everyone will find this prospect appealing.Brace for a year in which the campaign, the markets, and the economy collide and clash in ways that are hard to predict. And if others panic about this, try to keep your head about you…\n      "
