## Fine-tuning further with QA

The idea is to use this model as base for further fine tuning. Further fine-tuning is done by extracting some
relevant medical terms using NER (NLTK lib) and then extracting the sentences in the text containing the selected 
entities, and some n follwoing sentences

An example of such a model is './test9-t5/t5-base-trained-medical-epoch-50-2023-03-27 19:44:17.137498'

Script - `t5_train_model_qa.py`
Note - Since the (tokenized) lengths of different lengths are different, tokenization with pad to the largest in the batch was used. However the attention mask need to be set to zero for the padded tokens. That was missed //todo

Train data - `data/qa_dataset2.csv`
genereated from - `data/medical_ner.csv` using `data/named_entity_r.py` and `create_qa_set.py`

sometimes employed as a type with which to compare the ulcers seen at the
bedside, so that we may determine how far, and in what particulars,
these differ from the type; and that we may in addition recognise the
conditions that have to be counteracted before the characters of the
typical healing sore are assumed.
For purposes of contrast we may indicate the characters of an open sore
in which bacterial infection with pathogenic bacteria has taken place.
The layer of coagulated blood and lymph becomes liquefied and is thrown
off, and instead of granulations being formed, the tissues exposed on
the floor of the ulcer are destroyed by the bacterial toxins, with the
formation of minute sloughs and a quantity of pus.
The discharge is profuse, thin, acrid, and offensive, and consists of
pus, broken-down blood-clot, and sloughs. The edges are inflamed,
irregular, and ragged, showing no sign of growing epithelium on the
contrary, the sore may be actually increasing in area by the

## Fine-tuning for QA

GPT2 needs the input_ids and labels (targets) to be the same length as it uses causual masking. - masks word at position x in input_ids and uses the word at position x as the target for loss. The model sees all words up to x-1 postion for predicting the xth word.
